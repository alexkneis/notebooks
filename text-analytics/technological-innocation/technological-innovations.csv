While its use has improved the people’s living standards, it has also promoted the development of various industries. Technological progress has laid the foundation for the development of Internet technology. With the maturity of network technology, the regional economy has also developed very well. China has maintained a relatively high economic growth rate since the reform and opening up, and internal technological innovation is the basic guarantee for the healthy development of the regional economy. This shows that traditional economic growth methods can no longer meet the economic needs of modern society, and sustainable economic advancement with technology as the core is the main way to continue economic development. The positive promotion effect of technological innovation is very significant in regional development and has profound practical significance.",The Internet; Technological change; Standard of living; Business; Work (electrical); China; Regional development; Economic growth rate; Maturity (finance); Economic growth,,0

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance is an important factor to promote technological innovation, and venture capital (VC) as a matching capital with technological innovation also affects technological innovation. Using Chinese listed companies on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) during the 2014–2018 period as a sample, we study the role of corporate social responsibility performance in technological innovation and the impact of venture capital on the relationship between the two. We find that social responsibility performance can effectively promote innovation, which is promoted significantly by the shareholder responsibility and employee responsibility dimensions of social responsibility. We also find that venture capital inhibits the promotion of social responsibility to technological innovation. This work will guide VC institutions to pay more attention to business organizations social innovation projects.",Shareholder; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Social responsibility; Matching (statistics); Work (electrical); Venture capital; Industrial organization; Promotion (rank); Capital (economics),,1
000-159-349-888-829,Financial sustainability of the construction firms towards the era of industrial revolution 4.0: The role of technological innovation,2020-12-01,2020,conference proceedings article,Hui Shan Lee; Sin Yee Lee; Wai-Mun Har; Shen Yap,"As the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) momentum has developed recently, its transformation had made the global infrastructure gap narrower and stimulated economic development in general. However, the construction sector has been uncertain about entirely embracing new technological opportunities. The objective of this study is to examine the impacts of technological innovation on the financial performance of the contractor firms. This study employed panel regression models to examine the 30 largest contractors in the world with a sample period from the year 2010 to 2019. The results showed that technological innovation expenditure and the revenues generated from technological innovation were negatively related to the financial performance of the contractors in the current years. This study provided new insights that the lag effect of the technological innovation expenditure would prompt higher financial performance of the contractors. The results demonstrated that technological innovation might not induce higher revenues but the improvement in business performance was still observed. Rather than blindly increasing the revenues, these results indicated that technological innovation could enhance the project management and procedures, enrich the quality and boost the productivity of the contractors that lead to better financial performance. The implication of this study implied that technological innovation costs arise in the present, the benefits of research and development (R&D), however, are long-term. The lifeblood of the construction industry is R&D. Thus, appropriate promotion and funding of R&D are needed to foster the diffusion of innovations to ensure the sustainability of the construction sector and economic growth.",Business; Revenue; Productivity; Quality (business); Diffusion of innovations; Industrial organization; Sustainable development; Panel data; Sustainability; Promotion (rank),,1
000-283-265-401-188,"Financial agglomeration, technological innovation, and green total factor energy efficiency",,2021,journal article,Xuefeng Li; Dalai Ma,"Abstract Based on the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces in 2000–2018, this paper measures the green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE) of China with the super-slack-based measure (Super-SBM) model. Then, the spatial correlation of provincial GTFEEs was analyzed, a spatial econometric model was established based on the panel data, and was used to empirically verify the effect of financial agglomeration, technological innovation, and financial agglomeration and technological innovation interaction on GTFEE. The results show that: in the sample period, most Chinese provinces had a low GTFEE, and the low-GTFEE provinces mainly belong to inland area; only a few eastern coastal provinces achieved a satisfactory GTFEE. China and its three regions exhibited similar trends of GTFEE. By mean GTFEE, eastern region ranked the highest, followed by central region; the western region came at the bottom. The Global Moran’s I values show strong spatial correlations between provincial GTFEEs, that is, adjacent provinces often have similar GTFEEs, and the provinces tend to cluster in terms of GTFEE. According to the spatial econometric model, GTFEE is significantly inhibited by financial agglomeration, but significantly promoted by technological innovation. GTFEE is not clearly affected by financial agglomeration and technological innovation interaction. Opening up has a significant positive impact on GTFEE, while industrial structure, energy structure and environmental regulation have a significant negative impact on GTFEE.",Finance; Economies of agglomeration; Econometric model; China; Geography; Efficient energy use; Environmental regulation; Energy structure; Sample (statistics); Panel data,,15

The incentive and supervision are effective means to improve the performance of innovation. The purpose of this paper is to propose appropriate incentive and supervision mechanisms to reduce information asymmetry and improve the efficiency of incentives. Suggestions on technological innovation are put forward to megaprojects management.,According to the principal-agent theory, the research develops incentive models under three states, i.e. information symmetry, information asymmetry and information asymmetry based on supervision mechanism. The Bayesian theory is employed to prove the effectiveness of the novel supervision method based on risk assessment.,The results indicate that under the information asymmetry, the incentive intensity is positively correlated with the social benefits coefficient, and negatively correlated with the patent benefits coefficient. The R&D effort and the owner's incentive intensity decline with the increase of information asymmetry. The supervision of risks can effectively reduce the degree of information asymmetry, and the higher the uncertainty of innovations, the more significant the effect of supervision is. As the supervision intensity increases, the incentive intensity, the R&D effort and the innovation output will increase. In addition, the R&D institutions with high innovation capability, low unit cost of R&D and low risk-aversion are more willing to make efforts to innovate.,This study fills the research gap on incentive and supervision of technological innovation in megaprojects. The externality of innovation benefits is considered in the model. The traditional incentive model is extended through the introduction of supervision. Furthermore, a novel supervision method based on risk assessment is proposed. The results validate the importance of risk management in technological innovation and provide a new insight for project management.",Information asymmetry; Business; Project management; Externality; Principal–agent problem; Moral hazard; Incentive; Risk management; Industrial organization; Unit cost,,8

Accordingly, the study investigated whether the effect of consumers’ innovative attitudes on their adaptation to technological innovation and whether perceived value (Zeithaml, 1988), which is a highly influential factor in consumers’ decision making, mediates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - After the data obtained from 540 smartphone users were subjected to some preliminary analysis, the relationships between variables were measured by structural equation modeling. Within the scope of the analysis of the study, in accordance with the purpose of the study, firstly, independence check test of answers, common method deviation test, descriptive analysis, normality test, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, explanatory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and finally path analysis were performed. Findings - According to the findings, the innovativeness of the consumers affects both the perceived value of the consumers and the adaptation towards technological innovations in a significant and positive way. The perceived value also affects the adaptation towards technological innovation in a significant and positive way. In addition, it has been determined that as consumer innovativeness increases with the partial mediation role achieved as a result of the analysis, the effect of perceived value on adaptation to technological innovation strengthens. Discussion - Although there are a limited number of studies investigating the impact of consumer innovativeness in the adoption of innovations (Jones et al., 2002; Schreier et al., 2007; Tellis et al., 2009); No study has been found to determine the effect of the perceived value in the said relationship. Since it is thought that the tendency of innovative individuals to adapt to innovation, which they do not perceive value, will be low, the concept of perceived value, which is subjective and changes with the change and development of goods or services, was used as a mediator in the study.",Psychology; Marketing; Value (ethics); Test (assessment); Descriptive statistics; Confirmatory factor analysis; Mediation (statistics); Structural equation modeling; Path analysis (statistics); Adaptation (computer science),,0

The technological innovation of heavily polluting enterprises is conducive to reducing pollution emissions and promoting environmental health. The financial investment tendency and behavior of real enterprises have a significant impact on the technological innovation decision-making of enterprises. A panel model is used in this paper in order to empirically test the impact of financialization of Chinese heavily polluting enterprises on technological innovation based on the data of Listed Companies in Chinese heavily polluting industries from 2008 to 2019. The + results show that the financialization of heavily polluting enterprises has a significant crowding out effect on technological innovation. After introducing arbitrage motivation as the regulating variable, further research finds that arbitrage motivation weakens the inhibitory effect of enterprise financialization on technological innovation, that is, the stronger the arbitrage motivation, the smaller the negative effect of financialization on enterprise technological innovation, which weakens this crowding out effect. Finally, the listed enterprises in heavily polluting industries are divided into state-owned enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises according to their corporate attributes. Compared with state-owned enterprises, the financialization of non-state-owned enterprises has a greater squeeze out of technological innovation; and arbitrage motivation has a more significant regulatory effect on the impact of enterprise financialization on technological innovation.",Financialization; Arbitrage; Business; Economics; Industrial organization; Investment (military); Environmental pollution; Economic system,environmental pollution; financialization; heavily polluting enterprises; technological innovation,2

In this context, the Brazilian Ministry of Health pointed out the need for interoperability solutions of health information systems, noting the importance of integration with national databases and alignment with Brazilian data protection laws. Therefore, this paper presents Sabia, a platform for authentication, authorization, and data delivery based on user consent for health information systems in Brazil. Sabia’s architecture is designed to achieve the following requirements: (R1) Provide a Federated Identity; (R2) Be a Federated Resource Manager; (R3) Collect user data from different information systems; and (R4) Deliver user data to systems based on user consent. Sabia consists of three main components: (1) Sabia Authorization Server, responsible for implementing Open Authentication; (2) Sabia Collector, responsible for collecting data from different information systems; and (3) Sabia Resource Server, responsible for delivering data previously authorized by the user to the systems. After analyzing historical data, R4 functionality was selected to be submitted to performance testing because it is the process that most affects overall system performance. The tests aimed at analyzing Sabia’s behavior in the heaviest scenario based on historical data. The results showed no flaws and indicated system stability and consistency, in which the user perceives a system reaction instantaneous, whose response time averages remained below 100 ms.",Consistency (database systems); Health informatics; Authentication; Information system; Interoperability; Federated identity; Context (language use); Computer science; Data Protection Act 1998; Database,,0

First, the Network Slack-based model and Global Malmquist-Luenberger model are constructed to reveal the internal development law of technological innovation and green development of manufacturing industry. Secondly, the spatial Dubin model is employed to analyze the impact of current development characteristics and technological innovation on green development. The results show that innovation value chain efficiency is higher than technological innovation efficiency, and economic transformation efficiency is lower than that of technological innovation value chain. During the study period, the efficiency of technological innovation value chain in the four economic regions present fluctuant growth trend, and the eastern region has the highest value. The green development efficiency in the east, central, west, and northeast regions of manufacturing industry is higher than 1, and it shows an obvious spatial agglomeration effect. Besides, the efficiency of technological innovation, information and communication technology, urbanization, and the advanced industrial structure are all conducive to the improvement of green development in manufacturing industry.

Initially, the study employed the super-efficiency DEA model to estimate the ecological efficiencies of 30 regions in China. Following this, the system GMM method was used to explore the impacts of technological innovation, environmental regulations, and urbanization on ecological efficiency. We used annual data from 2008 to 2018. The results indicate that, in terms of ecological efficiency, the eastern region was the highest ranked, followed by central and western regions, respectively. The urbanization index has a negative impact on ecological efficiency at a national level. However, in the context of regions, it is positively significant in the eastern region, while the results in the central and western regions are insignificant. The influence of technological innovation on ecological efficiency is found to be significantly positive at both national and regional levels. It is generally perceived that environmental regulations are pivotal for sustainability. Our results verify this argument and indicate that environmental regulations have a positive impact on ecological efficiency in the central and eastern regions. However, their impact is found to be negative in the western region.

In previous studies, technological innovation capabilities were emphasized as a factor that enables SMEs to compete in the international market. To this end, SMEs need to cooperate with external partners to strengthen their technological innovation capabilities to thus improve their international performance. With the perspective view of open innovation, this research explores the effects of relational capital and technological innovation capability on international performance, with a particular focus on the moderating effect of alliance proactiveness. Building on previous literature regarding internationalization, technological innovation, and alliance proactiveness, research hypotheses were developed and tested using data collected from 175 SMEs. A hierarchical regression analysis was applied. The analysis showed that, first, relational capital had a significant effect on the technological innovation capability. Second, technological innovation capability has a significant influence on the international performance. Third, technological innovation capability mediated the relationship between relational capital and international performance. Finally, alliance proactiveness was found to moderate the relationship between technological innovation capability and international performance. The key research findings imply that relational capital and alliance proactiveness are the key factors of international performance, as they improved the development of the technological innovation capability.",Proactivity; Business; Open innovation; Alliance; Relational capital; Industrial organization; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Multilevel model; Capital (economics); Internationalization,,16

Three siliceous materials with different textural and surface properties (i.e., fumed silica and mesoporous Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA)-15 and Mobil Composition of matter (MCM)-41 materials) were considered and the effect of their physico-chemical properties on the toluene adsorption process was studied. In particular, FT-IR spectroscopy was used to qualitatively study the interactions between the toluene molecule and the surface of silicas, while volumetric adsorption analysis allowed the quantitative determination of the toluene adsorption capacity. The combined use of these techniques revealed that textural properties of the sorbents, primarily porosity, are the driving forces that control the adsorption process.

002-902-189-707-013,Research on the Impact of Environmental Regulation on Technological Innovation of Paper Industry Based on Gray Analysis Method,,2020,journal article,Donghong Shan; Chunxia Shan,"In recent years, the continuous development of economy has also promoted the vigorous development of China's paper industry, but the disadvantages of paper industry such as large water consumption and serious pollution are more prominent. Therefore, the government has formulated a series of environmental regulation policies to restrict the heavy pollution in the production process of paper industry. Research on the impact of environmental regulation on the technological innovation of the paper industry in the new era is conducive to improve the quality policy of environmental supervision of China's paper industry, which has good theoretical value and practical significance. The data in this paper are from a series of indicators of the paper industry from 2009 to 2018. Among them, the indicators to measure the level of technological innovation and the indicators to calculate the intensity of environmental regulation are selected. The relationship between the two is empirically analyzed by grey correlation method and regression analysis. The empirical results show that environmental regulation has a positive impact on technological innovation of China's paper industry.",Gray (horse); Business; Regression analysis; Quality policy; China; restrict; Water consumption; Environmental regulation; Analysis method; Pulp and paper industry,,1

Their influence is most pronounced in Kazakhstan, for a number of reasons, among which a higher standard of living of the population and, accordingly, the paying capacity of the audience, the depth of Internet penetration, the development of the communication sphere, etc. In this regard, the situation in Kazakhstan presented to be largely as a model for the entire region of Central Asia. The impact of communicative technological innovations in the Republic of Kazakhstan is manifested through the intensification of socio-political processes, the restructuring of society, through the emergence of new groups of influence, as well as the creation of dialogue and discussion platforms, often of an informal plan, which contribute both to the unification and differentiation of the social organism. This gives rise to various dilemmas in the choice of state approaches to the use of communicative technological innovations, which is expressed both in encouraging the development of the information and communication sphere, and in attempts to limit civic activity if it goes through the channels of new means of communication. The author suggests that in the coming years, the impact of communicative technological innovations on political processes in Kazakhstan will be under the sign of the two indicated contradictory tendencies (striving for freedom and control), especially considering the neighborhood with the two powers, China and the Russian Federation, with their predominantly repressive logic of interaction state with society.",The Internet; Sign (semiotics); Standard of living; Political science; State (polity); Population; Social organism; Public relations; Restructuring; Politics,,0

However, unique design challenges are associated with SRLs as they are mounted on the human body. SRLs must 1) be lightweight to avoid burdening the user, 2) be fast enough to compensate for human unpredictable motions, 3) be strong enough to accomplish a multitude of tasks, 4) have high force-bandwidth and good backdrivability to control interaction forces between the user and the environment. This letter studies the potential of a remotely actuated 3-DOF supernumerary robotic arm equipped with a 3 fingers soft gripper, both powered by magnetorheological (MR) clutches and hydrostatic transmission lines. The tethered configuration allows the power-unit to be located on the ground, which minimizes the remote mass (4.2 kg) on the user. MR clutches minimize the actuation inertia in order to provide fast dynamics and good backdrivability. An experimental open-loop force-bandwidth of 18 Hz is obtained at each joint and the maximal speed reached by the device end-effector is 3.4 m/s, which is sufficient for compensating human motions. In addition, the two first joints provide 35 Nm and the third joint provides 29 Nm, which is strong enough to hold manual industrial tools. Finally, the SRL is put in real practical situations, as fruit and vegetables picking, painting, tools holding and badminton playing. The capability of the proposed MR-Hydrostatic SRL to perform successfully various tasks with high speed and smoothness suggests a strong potential of SRLs to become future commonly used devices.",Magnetorheological fluid; Inertia; Robotic arm; Clutch; Computer science; Simulation,,30

Its conventional production starts from benzene and propylene and is based on a series of reaction steps most of which are catalyzed by acid catalysts. Besides this technology other ones have been considered during the last decades, starting from other reactants and catalysts. Looking at the catalyst types both already in use or under evaluation, it is interesting to note that zeolites, as acidic catalysts or red-ox catalysts, were widely investigated. Therefore, the production of phenol represents a fascinating example of how zeolite catalysis contributes to improving the sustainability of these chemical processes by displacing the previous large use of corrosive and dangerous liquid acids and improving overall selectivity, which reduces the side production of wastes. Aromatic alkylation, transalkylation, and disproportionation, oxidations, rearrangements, oligomerization, and cracking are the reactions occurring in phenol production technologies, but also key unit operations in refineries and the chemical industry. A review of the zeolite catalysts utilized and proposed by major licensors and research groups in these technologies is provided as well as a discussion of key process differences and recent advances.",Chemical industry; Chemical process; Catalysis; Alkylation; Organic chemistry; Chemistry; Benzene; Phenol; Zeolite; Transalkylation,,6

Considering this, we planned a systematic review to investigate the effects of BMI-controlled UL orthoses for rehabilitation of patients with neurological disorders. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was elaborated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P 2015) and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A search will be conducted on Pubmed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Medline, and Web of Science databases without language and year restrictions, and Patents Scope, Patentlens, and Google Patents websites in English, Spanish, French, German, and Portuguese between 2011 and 2021. Two independent reviewers will include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies using BMI-controlled active UL orthoses to improve human movement. Studies must contain participants aged >18 years, diagnosed with neurological disorders, and with impaired UL movement. Three independent reviewers will conduct the same procedure for patents. Evidence quality and risk of bias will be evaluated following the Cochrane collaboration by two review authors. Meta-analysis will be conducted in case of homogeneity between groups. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. Data will be inserted into a table containing physical description, UL orthoses control system, and effect of BMI-controlled orthoses. Discussion: BMI-controlled orthoses can assist individuals in several routine activities and provide functional independence and sense of overcoming limitations imposed by the underlying disease. These benefits will also be associated with orthoses descriptions, safety, portability, adverse events, and tools used to assess UL motor performance in patients with neurological disorders.

And the spatial spillover effect is greater than the direct effect, that is to say, the elasticity coefficient of the technological innovation ability of colleges and universities in the surrounding areas to the regional economic growth is greater than that of colleges and universities in the region. In addition, the investment of fixed assets, the process of urbanization and the scale of government only have the direct effect on the regional economic growth, and there is no spatial spillover effect. The scale of government and the opening-up have the direct effect and spillover effect. The conclusions for this study provide a useful reference for the government and universities to strengthen the technological innovation ability of universities so as to promote regional economic growth.",Business; Government; Economic geography; Investment (macroeconomics); National innovation system; Fixed asset; Urbanization; Spillover effect; Panel data; Scale (social sciences),,8

Holowko; Jingyun Zhang; Chang-Wei Kang; Hwa Liang Leo; Chueh Loo Poh,"Due to sustainability concerns, bio-based production capitalizing on microbes as cell factories is in demand to synthesize valuable products. Nevertheless, the nonhomogenous variations of the extracellular environment in bioprocesses often challenge the biomass growth and the bioproduction yield. To enable a more rational bioprocess optimization, we have established a model-driven approach that systematically integrates experiments with modeling, executed from flask to bioreactor scale, and using ferulic acid to vanillin bioconversion as a case study. The impacts of mass transfer and aeration on the biomass growth and bioproduction performances were examined using minimal small-scale experiments. An integrated model coupling the cell factory kinetics with the three-dimensional computational hydrodynamics of bioreactor was developed to better capture the spatiotemporal distributions of bioproduction. Full-factorial predictions were then performed to identify the desired operating conditions. A bioconversion yield of 94% was achieved, which is one of the highest for recombinant Escherichia coli using ferulic acid as the precursor.",Bioreactor; Biochemical engineering; Bioproduction; Biomass; Bioconversion; Ferulic acid; Environmental science; Bioprocess; Yield (chemistry); Aeration,bioproduction; bioreactor; cell kinetic model; computational fluid dynamics; vanillin,6

Equilibrium studies on the ligands and the Mn(II) complexes were carried out using pH potentiometry, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The Mn complexes that were formed by the two ligands were more stable than the Mn complexes of other pentadentate ligands but with a lower pMn than Mn(EDTA) and Mn(CDTA) (pMn for Mn(AMPTA) = 7.89 and for Mn(AMPDA-HB) = 7.07). 1H and 17O-NMR relaxometric studies showed that the two Mn-complexes were q = 1 with a relaxivity value of 3.3 mM-1 s-1 for Mn(AMPTA) and 3.4 mM-1 s-1 for Mn(AMPDA-HB) at 20 MHz and 298 K. Finally, the geometries of the two complexes were optimized at the DFT level, finding an octahedral coordination environment around the Mn2+ ion, and MD simulations were performed to monitor the distance between the Mn2+ ion and the oxygen of the coordinated water molecule to estimate its residence time, which was in good agreement with that determined using the 17O NMR data.",Ion; Chemistry; Chemical stability; Octahedron; Spectrophotometry; Piperidine; Spectroscopy; Molecule; Oxygen; Crystallography,Mn(II) chelates; NMR relaxometry; computational modeling; polydentate ligands; thermodynamic stability,0

Use of biosensors has facilitated strain engineering to efficiently produce value-added compounds. Following our recent work on the production of short branched-chain fatty acids (SBCFAs) in engineered <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, here we harnessed a weak organic acid transporter Pdr12p, engineered a whole-cell biosensor to detect exogenous and intracellular SBCFAs and optimized the biosensor's performance by varying <i>PDR12</i> expression. We firstly constructed the biosensor and evaluated its response to a range of short-chain carboxylic acids. Next, we optimized its sensitivity and operational range by deletion and overexpression of <i>PDR12</i>. We found that the biosensor responded to exogenous SBCFAs including isovaleric acid, isobutyric acid and 2-methylbutanoic acid. <i>PDR12</i> deletion enhanced the biosensor's sensitivity to isovaleric acid at a low concentration and <i>PDR12</i> overexpression shifted the operational range towards a higher concentration. Lastly, the deletion of <i>PDR12</i> improved the biosensor's sensitivity to the SBCFAs produced in our previously engineered SBCFA-overproducing strain. To our knowledge, our work represents the first study on employing an ATP-binding-cassette transporter to engineer a transcription-factor-based genetic biosensor for sensing SBCFAs in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Our findings provide useful insights into SBCFA detection by a genetic biosensor that will facilitate the screening of SBCFA-overproducing strains.",Biosensor; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Metabolic engineering; Transporter; Biochemistry; Chemistry,Saccharomyces cerevisiae; genetic biosensor; promoter; short branched-chain fatty acids; transporter; weak organic acids,0

The amino groups' distribution on the mesoporous silica nanoparticles was evaluated considering the aggregation state of a grafted photosensitizer (Verteporfin) by using spectroscopic techniques. The homogeneous distribution of amino groups within the silica network is a key factor to avoid aggregation during further organic functionalization and to optimize the performance of functionalized silica nanoparticles in biomedical applications. In addition, the formation of a protein corona on the external surface of both bare and amino-functionalized mesoporous silica was also investigated by adsorbing Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a model protein. The adsorption of BSA was found to be favorable, reducing the aggregation phenomena for both bare and amino-modified nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the dispersant effect of BSA was much more evident in the case of amino-modified nanoparticles, which reached monodispersion after adsorption of the protein, thus suggesting that amino-modified nanoparticles can benefit from protein corona formation for preventing severe aggregation in biological media.",Mesoporous silica; Bovine serum albumin; Nanoparticle; Mesoporous material; Silicon dioxide; Surface modification; Mesoporous organosilica; Chemistry; Photosensitizer; Chemical engineering; Materials science; Nanotechnology; Combinatorial chemistry,BSA; aggregation; amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles; co-condensation; grafting,3

Chesnut; In Young Hwang; Matthew Wook Chang,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the superior host cell culture models used for the bioproduction of therapeutic proteins. One of the prerequisites for bioproduction using CHO cell lines is the need to generate stable CHO cell lines with optimal expression output. Antibiotic selection is commonly employed to isolate and select CHO cell lines with stable expression, despite its potential negative impact on cellular metabolism and expression level. Herein, we present a novel proline-based selection system for the isolation of stable CHO cell lines. The system exploits a dysfunctional proline metabolism pathway in CHO cells by using a pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase gene as a selection marker, enabling selection to be made using proline-free media. The selection system was demonstrated by expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a monoclonal antibody. When GFP was expressed, more than 90% of stable transfectants were enriched within 2 weeks of the selection period. When a monoclonal antibody was expressed, we achieved comparable titers (3.35 ± 0.47 μg/mL) with G418 and Zeocin-based selections (1.65 ± 0.46 and 2.25 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). We further developed a proline-based coselection by using S. cerevisiae PRO1 and PRO2 genes as markers, which enables the generation of 99.5% double-transgenic cells. The proline-based selection expands available selection tools and provides an alternative to antibiotic-based selections in CHO cell line development.",Gene; Green fluorescent protein; Molecular biology; Chinese hamster ovary cell; Zeocin; Bioproduction; Proline; Monoclonal antibody; Selection (genetic algorithm); Biology,CHO cells; P5CS; coselection; monoclonal antibody; proline metabolism,4

Design/methodology/approach First, this paper gives the definitions of the lower bound domain, the value domain, the upper bound domain of interval grey number and the generalized measure and the generalized greyness of interval grey number. Then, based on the grey relational theory, this paper proposes the model of greyness relational degree of the interval grey number and analyzes its relationship with the classical grey relational degree. Finally, the model of greyness relational degree is applied to analyze the related factors of China's technological innovation ability. Findings The results show that the model of greyness relational degree has strict theoretical basis, convenient calculation and easy programming and can be applied to the grey number sequence, real number sequence and grey number and real number coexisting sequence.

The notable economic growth and the consequent speedy process of urbanization in BRICS countries have brought about colossal escalation of energy needs leading to environmental degradation. The present study endeavors to explore the effect of foreign direct investment, technological innovation, and financial development on carbon emissions in BRICS member countries, with data from 1990 to 2017. The results verify a strong cross-sectional dependence within the panel countries. The Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator shows that foreign direct investment, technological innovation, and financial development in the BRICS countries possess a negative and statistically significant long-run association with CO2 emissions, while economic growth, trade openness, urbanization, and energy use are found to contribute statistically significant and positive with carbon emissions. The current study chose to employ the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel causality test for examining the direction of causality. Findings reveal a bidirectional long-run causality running among financial development, economic growth, trade openness, urbanization, energy use, and CO2 emissions; on the contrary, unidirectional causality is found between foreign direct investment and carbon emissions. Consequently, for the BRICS member countries, the development of industries, financial institutions, and development of technological innovation are required to attract quality foreign direct investment.

As a result, the purpose of this research is to investigate the role of variables that contribute to the reduction of COE in these economies by using a dataset 1990 to 2019. GDP, [Formula: see text], renewable energy use (REC), and technical innovation (INNO) have been selected as the independent variables for this study. A strategy based on asymmetric ARDL (NARDL) technique is utilized in conjunction with a pooled mean group (PMG) estimation technique to investigate the asymmetrical relationships between COE and the exogenous variables under consideration. For the purpose of determining the direction of causality, the Granger non-causality test is utilized. Furthermore, a unidirectional causality is discovered between GDP and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as well as between GDP and technological innovation. An environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis has been confirmed to exist, and renewable energy has been identified as a significant variable in reducing COE. The study also confirmed that COE is reduced by positive technological innovation shocks and increased by negative shocks.

This research investigates the potential of economic growth, renewable energy use, and technological innovation to achieve Malaysia’s Paris Agreement by reducing CO2 emissions. Time-series data from 1990 to 2019 were utilized applying the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method. The empirical findings show that the coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant with CO2 emissions, indicating a 1% increase in economic growth is related to a 0.9% rise in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the coefficient of renewable energy use is negative and significant, which indicates that increasing renewable energy use by 1% is associated with CO2 emissions reduction by 0.3% in the long run. In addition, increasing technological innovation lowers CO2 emissions, implying that a 1% increase in the number of patent applications is linked to a 0.05% reduction of CO2 emissions. The empirical findings reveal that increased renewable energy use and technological innovation can reduce Malaysia’s carbon emission while economic growth deteriorates the environmental quality. Thus, effective implementation of policy measures to a low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy use, and financing technological innovation could help to achieve Malaysia’s Paris Agreement by reducing CO2 emissions.",Greenhouse gas; Renewable energy; Green growth; Natural resource economics; Sustainability; Economics; Climate change mitigation; Technological change; Low-carbon economy; Sustainable development; Environmental economics,,10

The paper departs from an adapted analytical framework based on the technological innovation systems approach. Our review identifies four decades of Swedish research that has largely failed to drive domestic commercialization, the rise and fall of an industry that mainly served international markets, and a rapidly growing domestic market based on imported products. This situation is the result of mismatches and fragmentation among key innovation processes, which have not been addressed by strategic policy interventions. We suggest that policymakers should promote a full range of innovation processes and consider making innovation support subject to a payback mechanism that delivers a return on public investments even if industries and markets emerge abroad. Our study also demonstrates how the technological innovation systems approach can be extended to include the function commercialization and emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the directionality of technological innovation processes.",Business; Technological innovation system; Energy transition; Technology policy; Key innovation; Commercialization; Domestic market; Industrial organization; Industrialisation; Function (engineering),,4

The development of green technology has become an important means to achieve sustainable development. Green technological innovation is a kind of technological innovation. However, because the goal of green technological innovation is different from that of traditional technological innovation, the dynamic mechanism of green technological innovation lies in the similarities and differences of traditional technological innovation. This paper focuses on data mining technology to design and optimize the enterprise green technology creation model. At present, clustering algorithm and association rule algorithm are important research contents in big data mining technology. Among them, the clustering algorithm refers to the process of grouping similar data objects in a large amount of data information, so that the approximate data information can be aggregated and clustered, which is convenient for data mining calculation. In the algorithm, the shortcomings of the original clustering algorithm, such as insufficient data processing and incomplete analysis, are improved, and the data processing is improved by 51.7%, which has a good processing effect on subsequent data preprocessing and dynamic incremental clustering. In the follow-up experiment, the role of green technology in corporate finance is reflected.",Cluster analysis; Computer science; Data pre-processing; Big data; Data mining; Data science; Sustainable development; Process (computing); Data processing; Path (computing); Preprocessor; Association rule learning,,0

However, the pathogenesis of obligate parasitic pathogenic microorganisms is still under investigation because they cannot reproduce and complete their life cycle on an artificial medium. The successful lifestyle of biotrophic fungal pathogens depends on their ability to secrete effector proteins to manipulate or evade plant defense response. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and effectoromics, insights into how the adaptation of biotrophic plant fungal pathogens adapt to their host populations can be gained. Efficient tools to decipher the precise molecular mechanisms of rust-plant interactions, and standardized routines in genomics and functional pipelines have been established and will pave the way for comparative studies. Deciphering fungal pathogenesis not only allows us to better understand how fungal pathogens infect host plants but also provides valuable information for plant diseases control, including new strategies to prevent, delay, or inhibit fungal development.

Technological innovation serves as a tool to abate the acute environmental crisis and continuously promote sustainable development by converting traditional economies into green economies. Pakistan is among the developing countries relying on conventional technology and energy resources to meet population and economy demands, which has led to a surge in greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants. The literature exploring green growth in the Pakistani context is scant; the present study will therefore fill this gap and explore the dynamic linkage between technological innovation and ISO 14001 with green growth in Pakistan in the presence of environmental challenges such as energy consumption and population growth. A novel grey relational analysis model approach is employed to examine the interrelationship between the study parameters. Results indicate that technological innovation is significantly correlated with green growth, and ISO 14001 also shows a substantial relationship with green growth. However, among the environmental challenges, energy consumption poses a barrier to green growth development as the country’s energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels as compared to renewables.

Evidence From China,,2020,journal article,Meili Zhang; Baizhou Li; Shi Yin,"Technological innovation is increasingly becoming an important way to develop a low-carbon economy. Recently, exploring the driving path of low-carbon development has become the hot topic, however, the role of energy consumption in the carbon-reduction effect of technological innovation has been ignored. Based on China's provincial-level panel data from 2005 to 2016, this paper investigates the effect of technological innovation on energy saving and carbon emissions reduction and the role of energy consumption in the influencing process by using linear regression model, mediating effect model and threshold regression model. The results show that technological innovation has effectively promoted energy saving and carbon emissions reduction in China, with different effect coefficients between the three areas of China. Moreover, energy consumption plays a significant partial mediating role in the effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions reduction. Finally, the effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions is limited by energy consumption. Low energy consumption significantly promotes a reduction in carbon emissions through technological innovation. Once energy consumption exceeds a critical level, the promoting effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions reduction will turn into the inhibiting effect. Based on these findings, some policy recommendations are put forward to accelerate the low-carbon transformation of the economy.",Environmental economics; Consumption (economics); Economics; China; Energy consumption; Critical level; Greenhouse gas; Panel data; Energy (esotericism); Reduction (complexity),,9

The existing literature has studied the impact of energy consumption on green economic performance. However, the literature has ignored the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on China’s green economy performance. In this regard, this research uses the non-radial distance function (NDDF) to calculate the green economic performance of China’s prefecture-level cities, and uses the dynamic panel threshold model and the systematic GMM method to study the nonlinear impacts and mechanisms of environmental regulation, digital development, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade on green economic performance. The panel data set contains 228 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2019. The following findings are established: first, after adding carbon dioxide emissions to China’s green economy performance, the environmental performance was reduced, and the green economy performance was also reduced. Second, the impact of environmental regulations on green economic performance has a double-threshold effect, with threshold values of −0.267 and 3.602, and this double-threshold effect has temporal and regional heterogeneity. Third, environmental regulations of different intensities have a single-threshold effect between digital development, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade, with threshold values of 2.955, 3.957, and 2.249, respectively. Fourth, digital development, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade promote green economic performance. Fifth, environmental regulation acts on green economic performance through the transmission of digitalization, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrade. Based on these empirical findings, this research suggests that Chinese local governments should appropriately increase the intensity of environmental regulations, strengthen the digital application and technological innovation, and promote the upgrading of industrial structure to achieve the improvement of urban green economic performance.</jats:p>",Panel data; Upgrade; China; Green economy; Technological change; Economics; Environmental economics; Industrial organization; Economy,,7

It requires well-trained dedicated professionals who give one-on-one consultations with students. While this approach is somewhat successful. In practice, advisers spend much time repeatedly answering questions that can be efficiently learned by an intelligent system. There have been several attempts to automate academic advising by means of expert systems and chatbots. However, functionality has been prioritized over usability. In response, we contribute, UniBud, a virtual academic adviser which is designed with usability principles in mind. UniBud uses DialogFlow, a natural language understanding platform, to build voice-based interactions with students. The interactions allow students to inquire about course information, enrollment, and other general enquiries. UniBud is not meant to replace traditional academic advising. Instead, it will support a limited set of academic enquiries that can relieve human academic advisers to assist students with more involving enquiries.

We treat the Air Pollution Prevention Policy as a quasi-natural experiment that is plausibly exogenous to the firms’ innovation policy and thus use the difference in difference (DID) as an identification strategy in our analysis. We provide evidence that environmental regulation substantially promotes innovation productivity. Our findings reveal that this impact is more pronounced for state-owned firms, pollution-intensive industries, and high-tech-intensive industries. We uncover three possible underlying economic mechanisms through which the air pollution reduction policy impacts innovation. We show that government financing, external governance from the capital market, and R&D intensity are three underlying economic channels through which environmental regulation promotes technological innovation.

The majority (60%) of the customers are satisfied by banking and related financial services offered by co-operative enterprises in Kenya. This is below the expectations of what the customers perceive and what is realized at the point of service delivery. This study sought to provide insights into the relationship between technological innovation promoters and performance by empirically testing the direct effect of technological innovation promoters on performance and exploring the moderation effects of service quality practices. The study is anchored on the promoter theory and collective entrepreneurship concept. The study used a self-administered questionnaire to Chief Executive Officers of 158 Savings and Credit Co-operative Societies (SACCOs). Data were analyzed by employing Statistical Software for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 and structural equation modeling using AMOS version 25. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and hierarchical moderated multiple regression (MMR). Overall, the study found out that, technological innovation promoters have a positive influence on the performance of SACCOs in Kenya, and service quality practices (R2 change) is 0.153. This implied that the moderating effect of service quality practices gained 15.3% variance in the SACCOs above and beyond the variance by technological innovation promoters and performance. This study concludes that an integrative model comprising of technological innovation promoters, service quality practices and performance is a sure way of enhancing collective entrepreneurship and recommends that SACCO management together with their partners should deliberately nurture a customer relationship management culture that will enable them to realize positive performance that has been influenced by service quality practices",Nature versus nurture; Financial services; Service quality; Business; Marketing; Variance (accounting); Structural equation modeling; Entrepreneurship; Moderation; Customer relationship management,,0

A careful control of the lanthanide dopant loading is considered to enhance the photoemission properties of the lanthanide ions (Er, Pr, Yb) inside the ZrO2 crystal structure. The nanosystem with the lowest lanthanide loading maintains the size, phase and morphology of pristine ZrO2 nanoparticles and exhibit the best performances in term of the overall luminescence properties. Upon functionalization with a silica shell to covalently bound Rose Bengal, a theranostic platform is prepared which is very efficient in singlet oxygen generation, as demonstrated by EPR and UV–vis spectroscopy studies. Preliminary cell viability tests show that while both pristine and Ln doped ZrO2 nanoparticles do not exert cytotoxicity, neither upon illumination nor in dark condition, Rose Bengal grafted samples are able to significantly reduce cell viability under light exposure, thus confirming the high potential of these nanoparticles as PDT tools.",Surface modification; Luminescence; Nanoparticle; Chemistry; Dopant; Lanthanide; Singlet oxygen; Rose bengal; Photosensitizer; Photochemistry,,3

Deeply discussing the effect of digital economy on high-quality economic development and clarifying the mechanism behind it can effectively grant the boosting power of digital economy to China’s high-quality development, which is of great practical significance to China’s sustainable economic development. In this study, the mechanism, effect, and regional heterogeneity of the impact of the digital economy on the level of high-quality economic development in 30 Chinese provinces from 2011–2019 were measured and empirically tested using a mediating effects model and a spatial Durbin model, among others. The results showed that the overall level of digital economy and high-quality development is not high, and there were both high agglomeration and low agglomeration, with obvious spatial path dependence and spatial lock-in. Digital economy could promote the high-quality development level of the economy, and the spatial spillover effect was remarkable. In addition, the function of digital economy in promoting high-quality economic development in the eastern, central, and western regions was gradually weakened. Besides, the technological innovation was an important transmission path of digital economy to high-quality economic development. Based on these findings, it is proposed that decision-makers should strengthen digitalization efforts so that the digital economy can become a powerful tool to narrow the digital divide. Further, the dynamic and differentiated digital economy development strategy should be implemented to reduce regional development imbalances in an effective manner.</jats:p>",Digital economy; Sustainable development; Quality (philosophy); Economic system; China; Economics; Business; Economy; Industrial organization,,21

However, there are significant performance gaps to be bridged between solid electrolytes and liquid electrolytes; one with a particular importance is the ionic conductivity which is highly dependent on the material types and structures. In this review, the general physical image of ion hopping in the crystalline structure is revisited, by highlighting two main kernels that impact ion migration: ion hopping pathways and skeletons interaction. The universal strategies to effectively improve ionic conductivity of inorganic solid electrolytes are then systematically summarized: constructing rapid diffusion pathways for mobile ions; and reducing resistance of the surrounding potential field. The scoped strategies offer an exclusive view on the working principle of ion movement regardless of the ion species, thus providing a comprehensive guidance for the future exploitation of solid electrolytes.",Electrolyte; Fast ion conductor; Ionic conductivity; Conductivity; Materials science; Ion; Flammability; Ionic liquid; Diffusion; Ionic bonding; Chemical physics; Nanotechnology,batteries; ion hopping; ion transport mechanisms; ionic conductivity; solid electrolytes,1

However, innovation companies face high risks because innovation requires a lot of resources, and it is difficult to predict a payback period in advance. This is common for all types of innovation, but especially to technological innovation. One of the least researched technological innovations is telematics, innovative transport monitoring and control technology solutions. Those are widely applied in logistics, car-sharing platforms and the public transport sector. These innovations help to achieve the goals of the companies that buy and install them, but question what impact they have on the competitiveness of the companies that create these innovations remains a matter of debate. To fill this gap, the purpose of this article is to determine the impact of technological innovation on the competitiveness of telematics companies. In pursuit of this goal, the concepts of technological innovation and competitiveness are revealed. The definition of telematics innovation and its significance for the competitiveness of enterprises was also formed. The empirical part discusses the telematics market, provides the analysis of the main competitiveness indicators of 8 telematics companies and their changes, as well as the analysis of the research and development (R&amp;D) costs and the impact of innovations on competitiveness. Applied research methods: a critical analysis of scientific literature, generalization, systematization of data, computation, and comparison of relative indicator, data dispersion indicator, and dynamics indicator, correlation, and regression analysis. The research reveals that creation and development innovation are related to competitiveness of telematics companies. However, excessive investment into innovation no longer generates positive return.</jats:p>",Business; Industrial organization; Telematics,,0

This protein displays a peculiar nucleolar localization and it has recently been implicated in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. Here, we report the identification of a novel function of Che-1 in the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis, in both cancer and normal cells. We demonstrate that Che-1 interacts with RNA polymerase I and nucleolar upstream binding factor (UBF) and promotes RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. Furthermore, this protein binds to the rRNA gene (rDNA) promoter and modulates its epigenetic state by contrasting the recruitment of HDAC1. Che-1 downregulation affects RNA polymerase I and UBF recruitment on rDNA and leads to reducing rDNA promoter activity and 47S pre-rRNA production. Interestingly, Che-1 depletion induces abnormal nucleolar morphology associated with re-distribution of nucleolar proteins. Finally, we show that upon DNA damage Che-1 re-localizes from rDNA to TP53 gene promoter to induce cell-cycle arrest. This previously uncharacterized function of Che-1 confirms the important role of this protein in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation and response to stress.",RNA polymerase I; RNA polymerase; Ribosome biogenesis; Transcription (biology); RNA polymerase II; RNA; Ribosomal RNA; Biology; Ribosome; Cell biology,,9

Новікова; Ірина Олександрівна Ряполова,"It has been established that the mechanism for introducing technological innovations provides for initial costs for relevant marketing research, which are the basis for determining the need for a particular product. It was found that the demand for certain products for its evolutionary or revolutionary changes contribute to the emergence of demand for technology and equipment. Thus, food enterprises, developing the consumer market and stimulating certain preferences of consumers, fall into the circle of changing needs, which forces enterprises to introduce technological innovations. It was determined that the mechanism for introducing technological innovations should include both organizational and technological parts, as a result of which mistakes in choosing equipment and technology, both of a technological nature and marketing, can be avoided. It is proved that technological innovation is a factor in the further development of product innovations, which in turn contribute to the formation of infrastructure and marketing innovations. It has been found that the share of enterprises engaged in innovation is quite stable, but the total cost is gradually increasing, including the cost of acquiring new technologies and equipment. Innovation in enterprises, especially in the food industry, requires a qualitatively new approach. It should not be a single act of implementation of any type of innovation, but a strategically oriented system of measures for the development, implementation, development, production, commercialization and evaluation of innovation performance. It has been found that, in most cases, innovations in the food industry are cosmetic, not cardinal (pseudo-innovation takes place). But despite it it is proved that technological innovations with a catalyst for other innovations - product, infrastructure, marketing, which creates a systematic innovation in enterprises.

The report explores international trade by separately considering imports and exports. The results indicate that the data cross-sections are dependent and that the panel has slope heterogeneity. The results of the co-integration study indicate that imports, exports of technological innovation, GDP, and demand-related carbon emissions are co-integrated with systemic splits (2001 mild recession, 2008 financial crises, and 2011 decline of stock market, and 2014 export decline). The cross sectionally augmented autoregressive distributive lag model results show that technological innovation and exports have a negative effect on the use of carbon. Meanwhile, imports and GDP are positive associated with carbon emissions based on consumption. The analysis of the robustness test also verifies these impacts.

Technology of the new paradigm is gradually finding it ways in the activities of public administration. It is therefore argued that, through the innovation of technologies, service delivery can be effective and efficient but reduce the workforce. How then can the Nigerian public administration survive technological era with the nature of reduced workforce? Can the Nigerian public administration blend with the paradigm in the post covid-19 period? Answers to these questions were provided in the body of the work. Secondary research method was adopted in this paper with a theoretical back-up; data were sourced from the internet, journals, article, textbooks and newspaper. The findings reveal that advanced technological innovation is hope for the Nigerian public administration. However, public administration after covid-19 may face with challenge of gross job displacement because of the technology paradigm; it will also encourage further cybercrime and terrorism in Nigeria. The paper concludes that Nigerian public administration needs to strengthen its policy to balance all obstacles in order to make the innovation an attainable one. The paper therefore recommended that government should strengthen public administration by creating more jobs from other sectors such as agriculture, government should also make technology a compulsory course for students so that after graduation, the students will be technological relevant",The Internet; Business; Government; Work (electrical); Secondary research; Terrorism; Workforce; Cybercrime; Public administration; Service delivery framework,,0

This paper discusses the mechanism of technological innovation and regional economic co-evolution, and constructs an index system to assess them based on the principles of synergy and systematics. The authors use a dynamic coupling model to study the law of the cooperative evolution of composite systems and geo-detector methods to reveal the main factors controlling the degree of coordination among them. The results show that the total factor productivity of China's high-tech industry showed a ""W""-type trend of change from 2006 to 2016, and the other indices exhibited a volatile trend. The total factor productivity, technical efficiency, scale efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and technological progress increased by 37%, 13.3%, 3.9%, 9%, and 20.8%, respectively. There was a significant spatial difference in changes in total factor productivity, forming a core-edge spatial pattern with the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River as the center of concentration. Most of China's technological innovation and regional economic complex systems were in a state of interactive development from 2007 to 2016, except in the three northeastern provinces of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and the western part of the country. The degree of coupling of the other provinces showed an increasing trend, and the overall degree of coupling exhibited the spatial pattern of Central > Eastern > Western > Northeastern. The three most influential factors for the degree of coupling of China's provincial complex system were the gross domestic product, efficiency of technological innovation, and expenditure on research and development, whereas the three most important factors affecting the degree of coupling of complex systems were the efficiency of technological innovation, gross domestic product, and number of high-tech enterprises as well as research and development personnel, respectively, in the eastern, central, western, and northeastern regions.

This paper uses the Tobit model to conduct empirical analysis on the input and output data of technology finance in multiple provinces and cities and explores the impact of various factors on technology finance efficiency from the perspective of three technology finance entities: high-tech enterprises, governments, and venture capital companies. Based on the DEA model and Malmquist index model in the data envelopment analysis method, this paper uses deap software to calculate the efficiency of agricultural science and technology resource allocation in Gansu Province and the efficiency of agricultural science and technology operation in many provinces in the western region. This paper divides the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources into the ability to allocate scientific and technological innovation resources and the allocation efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resources. By constructing a performance evaluation system for the allocation of scientific and technological innovation resources, it is found that there are obvious differences in the ability and efficiency of scientific and technological innovation resource allocation in various regions. This paper proposes the selected efficiency evaluation method, the multiple regression model, which uses the data from 2012 to 2018 to evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of scientific and technological financial resources in my country, calculates the efficiency value of each region, and conducts a comparative analysis of provinces and regions. Research shows that, through multiple regression model analysis, the total technical efficiency of technology finance in Northeast China rose from 0.759 fluctuations in 2012 to 0.922 in 2018, gradually reducing the difference with the eastern and western regions. The overall promotion plays a significant role.

FDI has played a significant role in promoting Chinese economic development, and the FDI technology spillover effect is one of the core forces driving China towards reaching new growth milestones. Therefore, due to the country’s interest in development, there is competition for FDI throughout China. However, the existing imperfect environmental protection system cannot prevent FDI from flowing into China’s highly polluting and resource-intensive industrial chain, possibly causing serious environmental problems. Therefore, the topic of properly introducing foreign capital to promote development and effectively end China’s current environmental pollution crisis has become a research focus. To explore FDI’s impact on China’s economic growth, technological innovation, and environmental pollution, we use Chinese provincial panel data for 2004–2016 to construct a dynamic panel simultaneous-equation model. Considering the interrelationships between the equations, we construct economic models of economic growth, technological innovation, and pollution emissions, and incorporate them into the same research system for generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation. Our results show that FDI has a significant and positive direct impact on China’s economic growth and technological innovation, and can furthermore have a significant pull effect on the domestic economy through the backward spillover channel. At the same time, FDI has a direct and significant impact on the increase in regional waste-water discharge, while exhibiting a pollution halo effect on the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions directly. In addition, we observe “benign feedback mechanism” between technological innovation output and these three types of pollution, namely SO2 emission, COD emissions, and ammonia and nitrogen discharge.",Economic model; Economics; International economics; China; Competition (economics); Environmental pollution; Foreign direct investment; Pollution; Spillover effect; Panel data,FDI; dynamic panel simultaneous equation model; economic growth; innovation; pollution,13

This prompts the questions of whether a technological innovation system for small wind exists, how well the system functions are fulfilled, and how the diffusion of technology is either blocked or induced. Using an innovation systems perspective and a technological innovation systems approach, data was sourced from literature, small wind business firms, and other actors. A technological innovation system for small wind is established to exist as most of the key actors are present; however, the system functions are weakly fulfilled. Key blocking mechanisms are in the functions of market formation, knowledge development, resources mobilisation, and guidance of the search. The function of creation of legitimacy has a weak inducing effect.

020-822-911-059-889,The Carbon Emission Reduction Effect of Technological Innovation on the Transportation Industry and Its Spatial Heterogeneity: Evidence from China,2021-09-12,2021,journal article,Tao Shi; Shucun Si; Jian Chan; Lingling Zhou,"The carbon reduction effect of technological innovation in the transportation industry is conducive to China’s anticipated realization of carbon neutrality. Therefore, we evaluated carbon emission reduction effect of technological innovation in the transportation industry in China. Based on the panel data of 30 sample provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet) from 2012 to 2018, using the Moran’I index and Getis-Ord Gi index, this paper analyzes the evolutionary trend and spatial autocorrelation of carbon emission in the transportation industry, and analyzes the impact of technological innovation on carbon emission levels of the transportation industry and its spatiotemporal differences by using the geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) model by using ArcGIS 10.4 software. The conclusions are as follows: The carbon emission level of China’s transportation industry generally has been rising steadily, showing a spatial distribution pattern of high emissions in the east and low emissions in the west. The cold spots are concentrated in the western region, and the hot spots are situated in the central and eastern regions. Technological innovation has a carbon reduction effect on the transportation industry in the eastern and north-eastern regions, while the effect in other regions is not obvious. However, there is an obvious “inverted U-shaped” relationship between technological innovation and the transportation industry’s carbon emissions. The technological innovation in the transportation industry will have a significant carbon reduction effect after breaking through the technical pain points. This carbon reduction effect has a higher effect on the western region than on the eastern region. In addition, the economic development level, the fiscal expenditure proportion of the transportation industry, the higher education level, and the proportion of fixed asset investment in the transportation industry have played a positive role in reducing carbon in the transportation industry, but the spatial heterogeneity of this carbon reduction effect is relatively strong. Therefore, during the “14th Five-Year Plan” development period in China, it is necessary to continuously promote the low-carbon development of the transportation industry with technological innovation, while highlighting the differentiated carbon reduction governance, and consolidating the role of talents and fiscal support.",Carbon neutrality; Business; China; Economic geography; Investment (macroeconomics); Index (economics); Fixed asset; Greenhouse gas; Carbon; Panel data,,8

Few NACs have been reported for interactions between wheat and the wheat rust fungus Puccinia triticina (Pt). In this study, based on analysis of RNA-seq data from wheat line TcLr19 inoculated by Pt, the NAC transcription factor TaNAC069 was cloned from wheat, and its transcriptional activity and homologous dimer formation were verified. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of TaNAC069 was induced by Pt and associated signaling molecules. To further characterize the function of the TaNAC069 gene in wheat resistance to Pt, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was utilized, and it revealed that Pt resistance in TaNAC069-silenced plants was significantly reduced. Potential interaction targets of TaNAC069 from wheat and Pt were screened and identified by yeast two-hybrid technology. Eukaryotic elongation factor eEF1A, CBSX3 protein, and cold acclimation protein WCOR410c were screened by yeast one-hybrid technology. The results indicate that the TaNAC069 gene plays a positive regulatory role in wheat resistance to Pt, laying a good foundation to analyze the molecular mechanisms of TaNAC069 and its functional role in wheat resistance to Pt.",Gene; RNA-Seq; Gene silencing; Elongation factor; Cell signaling; Yeast; Cold acclimation; Biochemistry; Transcription factor; Biology,NAC transcription factor; Puccinia triticina; RNA-seq; VIGS; clone,3

Panel data showing the number of patents for climate change mitigation technology as a measure of innovation are obtained from 54 countries for the period 1990–2015 to verify whether technological innovation is effective in reducing GHG emissions and whether it has a significant synergetic relationship with the Kyoto Protocol. The historical trends in the number of patents for climate change mitigation technology reveal a relationship between the Kyoto Protocol and technological innovation and show differences between specific types of mitigation technology. Based on these innovation data, this study conducts two-stage least squares analysis that considers the time-lag effect. The empirical results confirm that mitigation innovations for buildings and the production or processing of goods have a strong positive association with GHG emission reduction. The findings also support the long-term synergetic effect between innovation and participation in the Kyoto Protocol in terms of GHG mitigation. This study contributes to international climate change governance by providing empirical evidence for technological innovation’s role in strengthening the effectiveness of international regimes and implications for promoting open innovation.",Climate change; Environmental economics; Business; Open innovation; Empirical evidence; Corporate governance; Greenhouse gas; Climate change mitigation; Panel data; Kyoto Protocol,,0

Design/methodology/approach – This argument is based on three pillars. The first one refers to a bibliographic review of theoretical frameworks related to academic entrepreneurship and technological innovation to emphasize the disruptive innovation capacity of academia. Second, a few elements related to the Brazilian political, economic and structural scenario, which entail a (more) favorable environment to technological innovation and academic entrepreneurship, is presented. Finally, concepts related to OSH and its business model are approached to demonstrate the facilitating effect toward the whole process. Findings – As a result of the argument made herein, it is possible to perceive the viability of the OSH model in terms of entrepreneurship and technological innovation in the academic sphere, and to perceive its benefits before social and economic needs in areas such as health and education. Research limitations/implications – There are no empirical or quantifiable data in the literature that enable comparison between OSH and traditional technological innovation models. Originality/value – The considerations on the philosophical value of OSH and its business models are scarcely explored in international literature. As far as we know, relating OSH to technological innovation entrepreneurship in the academic sphere, as well as its singularities in Brazil regarding the innovation national system and social and economic demands, is a unique approach in literature.",Political science; Value (ethics); Originality; Disruptive innovation; Argument; Business model; Process (engineering); Open source hardware; Knowledge management; Entrepreneurship,,4

Mohamad; Jianlong Wang; Xiaodong Yang,"China's green growth has shown a trend of fluctuation year by year. Simultaneously, Chinese local governments have pursued simple economic growth driven by the interests of ""political competition"" for a long time, while the supervision of the ecological environment has been loosened and tightened. In this environment, financial development and technological innovation may easily become the accelerator of this phenomenon, thus exacerbating the fluctuation of green growth. To deeply excavate the key factors to achieve stable and sustained growth of green economy, based on the annual panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2018, this paper studies the impact of financial development and technological innovation on the volatility of green growth using dynamic system GMM method. The findings of this paper are shown as follows: First, the expansion of financial institutions' scale will significantly enhance the volatility of green growth. Second, the increase in the scale of the stock market will also significantly cause green growth fluctuations. Third, the interaction between financial development and technological innovation can significantly weaken the volatility of green growth. Fourth, financial development measured by stock market indicators is more efficient than financial development measured by financial institutions indicators to curb the volatility of green growth. Fifth, the fluctuation of green growth in the previous period will reduce the volatility of green growth in the current period. This study provides new evidence for exploring the power source to promote the stability and sustainable growth of the green economy in the special stage of financial and technological integration. Controlling the development scale of financial institutions and removing their state preferences, expanding the development of capital markets, and deepening the integration of financial development and technological innovation are conducive to achieve stable green growth.",Sustainable growth rate; Capital market; Economics; Green economy; Green growth; Stock market; Competition (economics); Monetary economics; Panel data; Volatility (finance),Financial development; Green growth; System GMM; Technological innovation; Volatility,27

Battery recycling research is beneficial not only for controlling toxic and harmful substances, but also for public health. In addition, battery recycling brings value-added benefits to company management. As the most important link in the battery supply chain, the driving mechanism of battery recycling in the new electric vehicle industry will become particularly important. The subject of battery recycling is diverse, and the relationships among influencing factors are complex, thereby presenting a fluctuating state. Against this background, this study constructs a system dynamics model from the perspective of a main sorting and recycling system, a technological innovation subsystem and a replacement subsystem. Moreover, this study examines the driving mechanism of the power battery recycling system of a microlevel company. Focusing on the systematic impact of technological innovation capability and substitution, we find that the technological innovation drive of companies increases the total effect of required costs and product demands. It is embodied in two aspects, that is, the increase in the recovery rate leads to an increase in demand, whereas the increase in actual expenditures is less than the increase in technology-driven benefits. After technological innovation capability is improved, the effect of the technological innovation multiplier on the driving mechanism of companies is shown as rapid response time changes. In the substitution component of a company recycling system, we find that the maximum substitution rate limiting expectations has no significant impact on product differentiation. The leading effect of technological innovation capability is more obvious than that of substitution activity. Based on these findings, several suggestions for company operation and environmental governance are presented.",Supply chain; Business; Electric vehicle; Environmental governance; Battery recycling; Power battery; Waste disposal; Product differentiation; Industrial organization; System dynamics,alternatives; battery recycling; system dynamics; technological innovation,2

To achieve the study objective, we explored the role of technological innovation, FDI, trade openness, energy use and economic growth toward carbon emissions. Using the data of 1985-2017, the study employed ARDL bound testing and VECM methods to capture the effects of technological innovation, trade openness, FDI, energy use and economic growth on CO2 emissions. Empirical estimation has confirmed the existence of long-run cointegration. Similarly, in the long-run, it is found that trade openness, energy use and economic growth positively reinforce CO2 emissions. In contrast, technological innovation and FDI negatively reinforce CO2 emissions in the long-run. Further, VECM indicate that the relationship among innovation, trade openness, and energy use is bidirectional in the long-run. Whereas, unidirectional relation has been found that is coming from GDP to carbon emissions, FDI, innovation, trade, and energy use. In the short-run, unidirectional link found which is coming from FDI, innovation, and energy use to carbon emission. However, the association between emissions and trade openness is bidirectional.

However, none of the high profile web sites have implemented FIDO2 yet as password-less single factor (SF) authentication (password-less SF). In this paper, we analyze the set of factors that make websites reluctant to adopt password-less FIDO SF authentication. We start by comparing the threat models of password-less FIDO SF authentication with password-based SF authentication. Our analysis shows that although password-based authentication is less secure than FIDO SF authentication, other factors related to the usability of FIDO security keys and FIDO based authentication system, the non-consideration of enterprise requirements and the lack of specifications regarding account recovery/deletion and suspension are the main obstacles to the adoption of password-less FIDO SF authentication.",Password; Threat model; Usability; Authentication; Set (abstract data type); Identity (object-oriented programming); Single factor; Computer security; Computer science; Server,,4

From 1980 to 2019, the current study investigated symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships between environmental quality, patent, and trademark in Vietnam and Switzerland. ARDL approaches were used, both linear and nonlinear. The outcomes of the nonlinear analysis reveal that asymmetricity exit between technological innovations and environment quality in both Switzerland and Vietnam. In Switzerland, negative shock in the patent has a negative significance, and negative shock in trademarks has positive significant asymmetric effects on CO2 emissions in the short run. In Vietnam, positive shocks in technological innovations have substantial negative asymmetricity with the environmental pollution in the long run. Moreover, positive shocks in both trademark and patent have significant negative, whereas adverse shocks in trademark and patent have positive asymmetric effects on CO2 emissions in the long run.

In parallel, the profile of elemental excretion in urine was determined. Methods Chelation therapy by CaNa2EDTA was administered every two weeks and urine samples were routinely collected for 17 months. The samples were mineralized with HNO3 69 % and analyzed by Inductively-Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry. Data were processed by multivariate statistical methods. Results Most of the toxic elements showed a peak of excretion in 12−24 h after EDTA administration, which returned to basal level by 24−36 h after the treatment. Yet, the excretion of some trace elements persisted in the urine collected 26 h after the treatment. Conclusions The analysis of excreted metals following the CaNa2EDTA infusion allowed to monitor dynamically the chelation therapy. The chelation therapy was effective in mobilizing and eliminating the principal heavy metals present from the body. However, since such clearance almost vanished 24 h after the treatment, a protocol with more frequent and low-dose administrations is advisable to improve the metal excretion.",Excretion; Internal medicine; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Chelation; Heavy metals; Chelation therapy; Urine; Multivariate statistical; Multivariate analysis; Medicine; Gastroenterology,Chelation therapy; Elemental profile; ICP-MS; Metal intoxication; Multivariate data analysis; Urine,3

Diagnostic devices for assessing this health condition, such as Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), are very costly. Therefore, it is impracticable to meet the demand for tests in Brazil's 5,568 municipalities. Given that, we proposed a pre-clinical validation of a prototype developed to aid bone mineral density classification. Thus, Osseus integrates a microcontroller with other peripheral devices to measure the electromagnetic permittivity at the middle phalanx of the middle finger, with two antennas operating in the 2.45 GHz frequency range. Using Artificial Intelligence to identify risk factors alongside signal attenuation measurement indicates the need for DXA. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We conducted tests with plaster, Galliformes, and porcine bones.

Larson,"<p>For many, the promise of technological innovation is a source of optimism in the pursuit of water security. Improved technologies allow us to use water more efficiently and conserve our water resources. But some of these technologies face legal obstacles, or else, in the case of smart appliances and meters, cultural opposition. Water augmentation technologies could conceivably increase our water supply, through desalination or cloud seeding. But these technologies have environmental costs and raise complex questions regarding water allocation and equity as wealthy countries and communities augment their water supplies through costly means. Additionally, water represents both our hope and greatest challenge for a future among the stars. This chapter discusses the role of water law in advancing technologies for water conservation, managing technologies for water augmentation, and imagining the future legal regimes associated with water rights on other planets.</p>",Environmental economics; Business; Water security,,0

The study investigated the mechanism of antiherpes action of S. mombin extract, fractions, and geraniin. Different concentrations of samples were used to evaluate the in vitro antiherpes activity (anti-HSV-1) in virucidal, post-infection, attachment, and penetration assays. The mechanism of action of geraniin was investigated considering the glycoproteins gB and gD of HSV-1 surface as potential molecular targets. Molecular docking simulations were carried out for both in order to determine the possible binding mode position of geraniin at the activity sites. The binding mode position was posteriorly optimized considering the flexibility of the glycoproteins. The chemical analysis of samples was performed by LC-MS and revealed the presence of 22 substances, which are hydrolysable tannins, O-glycosylated flavonoids, phenolic acids, and a carbohydrate. The extract, tannin-rich fraction and geraniin showed important in vitro virucidal activity through blocking viral attachment but showed no relevant inhibition of viral penetration. The in silico approaches demonstrated a high number of potential strong intermolecular interactions as hydrogen bonds between geraniin and the activity site of the glycoproteins, particularly the glycoprotein gB. In silico experiments indicated that geraniin is at least partially responsible for the anti-herpes activity through interaction with the viral surface glycoprotein gB, which is responsible for viral adsorption. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of S. mombin anti-herpes treatment and provides support for its traditional purposes. However, further studies are required to validate the antiviral activities in vivo, as well as efficacy in humans.",Glycoprotein; Viral replication; Chemistry; In vitro; In vivo; In silico; Mechanism of action; Geraniin; Spondias mombin; Biochemistry,,11

Technological change is an evolutionary process. Research and technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that is irreversible in the sense that inventions can be superseded but not ""uninvented"". Technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that is cumulative because it lays a platform for further knowledge creation, or sets in place another rung in an ascending ladder of new performance characteristics or properties which are demonstrably superior to their antecedents. In turn, the asset specificity and irreversibility of technology and its cumulativeness create barriers to competitive entry. This allows a firm to earn the premiums that create market power and allow further innovation to be financed. The model of technological innovation advanced in this thesis has at its core the strategic governance framework of a firm, within which the dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are catalysed and made productive by differentiated technological learning processes. No one type of technological learning applies universally, but rather learning is differentiated by variables such as firm size and structure, the past experience and core competencies of the firm, its human capital stocks, social processes, interactions with the external environment, and a host of market, institutional and technological factors. It is argued that the dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are fundamental and necessary conditions of technological innovation. Technological learning processes underly and provide a connecting thread that integrates these necessary conditions into a model of technological innovation that can be applied by managers to create and sustain competitive advantage. Technological learning both shapes and is shaped by the human capital stocks and social processes of a firm. Learning processes give rise to significant new technology, and the dynamics of that technology in turn helps catalyse and gives rise to further learning. The rate and direction of learning and of technological innovation is also driven by the firm's interaction with external sources of ideas and technology. To create competitive advantage through technological innovation business managers must address a firm's strategy, human capital-related assets, social processes and technological learning abilities. Policy managers must ensure that the public technostructure is in place to foster human capital creation within an economy and to facilitate access to new ideas and sources of stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",Technological change; Industrial organization; Business; Human capital; Competitive advantage; Process (computing); Knowledge management,,0

This study aims to explore the relationship between provincial eco-efficiency and technological innovation in China. The DEA model is used to measure the ecological efficiency of 30 regions in China by using the data from 2007 to 2017, and different spatial econometric models were used to explore the influencing factors of ecological efficiency. The results show that in terms of ecological efficiency, the western region has the highest ecological efficiency, and the eastern region has the lowest. However, with the acceleration of urbanization, the ecological efficiency of the three regions gradually declined, and the last three regions basically remained at the same level. Based on spatial econometric analysis, the relationship between technological innovation and ecological efficiency is discussed. The results show that technological innovation has a negative impact on ecological efficiency, which confirms the existence of the environmental Kuznets Curve. In addition, environmental regulation and education level can improve ecological efficiency, while urbanization rate can reduce ecological efficiency. At the same time, spatial spillover effect plays an important role in technological innovation, environmental regulation, education level and urbanization rate in the change of regional ecological efficiency.

This paper focuses on the impact of bettering the financial environment of digital finance on enterprise green technological innovation, as well as the mediating role of financing costs and financial flexibility in this process. Using China’s data on manufacturing enterprises listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2011 to 2018, the hypotheses are tested. The result suggests the following: (a) digital finance effectively promotes enterprises to carry out green technological innovation, specifically, the coverage and depth of digital finance can promote enterprises’ green technological innovation, but the degree of digitization has no significant impact; (b) digital finance improves the financial environment by making up the shortage of traditional financial system through reducing financing problems such as “financing difficulty,” “matching difficulty,” and “supervision difficulty,” which make effective contributions to enterprise green technological innovation; (c) financing costs negatively mediate the relationship between digital finance and enterprise green technological innovation, while financial flexibility positively mediates the relationship. Overall, our findings shed light on the role digital finance plays in shaping corporate environmental behavior—and ultimately innovation in sustainability—in financing constraint setting.</jats:p>",Finance; Business; Financial innovation; Digitization; Economic shortage; Flexibility (engineering); China; Industrial organization,,3

The study of the relationship between their scientific and technological innovation capabilities and corporate performance is of far-reaching practical significance for guiding companies to formulate independent innovation strategies scientifically, improving their independent innovation capabilities, and promoting further transformation into an innovative country. In view of the large-scale technological innovation enterprise network, the traditional technological innovation enterprise performance prediction method cannot fully reflect the real-time technological innovation enterprise status. Aiming at the deficiencies of the existing short-term technology innovation enterprise forecasting methods, this paper proposes a technology innovation enterprise performance forecasting method based on deep learning. I analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of the data of technological innovation enterprises and divide the data according to the temporal characteristics of technological innovation enterprises. According to the spatial relevance of technological innovation enterprises, grouping is carried out by setting different correlation coefficient thresholds. The method of spectral decomposition is used to divide the data of scientific and technological innovation enterprises into trend items and random fluctuation items, to decompose the matrix of scientific and technological innovation enterprises, and to construct a compressed matrix using correlation. Using the deep belief network model in deep learning combined with support vector regression to establish a prediction model for technological innovation enterprises, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network model for performance prediction of scientific and technological innovation enterprises. Through the convolution operation and subsampling operation based on the concept of local window, the feature learning from the local to the whole is completed. This article uses the Naive Bayes model, logistic regression model, support vector regression model, and other mainstream methods to predict and compare the performance of technological innovation enterprises. I use the dropout method to reduce the impact of overfitting during training. The experimental results show that the deep neural network model method used in this article can achieve better prediction results than mainstream methods under the same characteristics. The experimental results on the data set confirm that the method of performance prediction of technology innovation enterprises based on deep learning used in this paper can effectively improve the results of performance prediction of technology innovation enterprises.",Deep learning; Support vector machine; Enterprise private network; Artificial intelligence; Overfitting; Computer science; Artificial neural network; Naive Bayes classifier; Knowledge management; Feature learning; Deep belief network,,0

The development of Alternative Communication software aids ALS patients in overcoming communication issues and the detection of communication signals plays a big role in this task. In this paper, volunteer eye-blinking is proposed as human–computer interaction signal and an intelligent Computer Vision detector was built for handling the captured data in real-time using a generic webcam. The eye-blink detection was treated as an extension of the eye-state classification, and the base pipeline used is delineated as follows: face detection, face alignment, region-of-interest (ROI) extraction, and eye-state classification. Furthermore, this pipeline was complemented with auxiliary models: a rotation compensator, a ROIs evaluator, and a moving average filter. Two new datasets were created: the Youtube Eye-state Classification (YEC) dataset, built from the AVSpeech dataset by extracting face images; and the Autonomus Blink Dataset (ABD), built completely as a result of the present work. The YEC allowed training the eye-classification task; ABD was specifically idealized taking into consideration volunteer eye-blinking detection. The proposed models, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), were trained by the YEC dataset and performance evaluation experiments for both models were conducted across different databases: CeW, ZJU, Eyeblink, Talking Face (public datasets) and ABD. The impact of the proposed auxiliary models was evaluated and the CNN and SVM models were compared for the eye-state classification task.

Therefore, this paper proposes an evaluation system based on the undesirable slack based model (SBM) and the Malmquist index model. Firstly, the evaluation index system of the green technological innovation efficiency of technology-based SMEs in Hebei Province was constructed from the perspectives of input and output, in which environmental pollution is included in the evaluation factors of green innovation activities. Then, the undesirable SBM and the Malmquist index model of green technology innovation efficiency evaluation were constructed. Finally, the technological innovation efficiency of technology-based SMEs in Hebei Province in different regions and time nodes was comprehensively calculated and combined with the Malmquist index model to analyze the efficiency changes of technology-based SMEs in Hebei Province over different years.

026-283-008-819-886,Impact of Tax Incentives on the Efficiency of Corporate Technological Innovation,2021-03-27,2021,conference proceedings article,Long Wu; Yunjing He,"By utilizing the 2010–2018 data of A-share listed companies in China, the corporate innovation efficiency is measured using the DEA model — the mechanism whereby tax incentives affect innovation efficiency is explored, and the moderating effects of property right nature and market competition on innovation motivation policies are analyzed. As the empirical results demonstrate, the overall level of technological innovation is rather low among China’s listed companies. Tax incentives play a significant role in promoting the efficiency of corporate technological innovation. Heterogeneity is present in their effect. In other words, tax incentives can significantly enhance the corporate innovation efficiency for non-state-owned enterprises while producing an insignificant effect in the case of state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, the degree of market competition increases the incentive effect of preferential tax policies with fiercer market competition, which reflects a more distinct effect of such policies. On the basis of these findings, policy suggestions are proposed for further perfecting the preferential tax policies and enhancing the efficiency of corporate technological innovation.",Information management; Business; Incentive; Market competition; Corporate innovation; Industrial organization; Property rights,,0

For this, the baseline studies and the final line evaluation of the Project have been used, carried out during the 2018 and 2020 period respectively, which allowed us to identify social and economic characteristics; on income, use of technologies, Covid19 context and distance from the EEAA. The research design is non-experimental, it was oriented towards a descriptive-cross-sectional study. The results of the probability model of use of technological innovations, it was determined that, during the period of 2018, the probability that a producer uses technological innovations on average is 46.54%. Likewise, if the producer is located in the range of distance 2 (R2), his probability of using technological innovations increases by 8.79% with respect to the probability of being in the radius of distance 1 (R1) (probability = 46.84%) . The opposite situation resulted in the case of distance radius 3 (R3), where the probability of using technological innovations is reduced by 7.68%, with respect to the probability of being in distance radius 1 (R1). In the case of the 2020 period, in the context of COVID-19, the effects of distance on the greater or lesser use of agricultural technologies are not clear, since the estimators are not statistically significant.; Likewise, the results of the income regression model indicate that, in the 2018 period, the distance to the agricultural experimental station negatively affects the income of small and medium agricultural producers in a differentiated way. This effect on producers' income is more negative to the extent that the producer is more isolated from the EEA. In the case of the 2020 period, in the context of COVID-19, the effects of distance on the income of producers are not clear, since the estimators are not statistically significant.",Agriculture; Economics; Inia; Context (language use); Probability model; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Welfare economics,,0

Technology plays an important role in the construction of smart cities. It is undeniable that under the technological innovation model of China, policies have a limited effect on economic development. How should China’s future smart city economic development policy be formulated? By establishing a theoretical model, it is found that when technological innovation models include imitative innovation, policies have a limited effect on economic growth. The theoretical model shows that the horizontal effect of factor accumulation cannot be ignored in the policy formulation process, but the policy direction should be changed from the past “quantity” to “quality”, that is, to improve the efficiency of capital and population utilization in cities.",Economics; China; Perspective (graphical); Smart city; Quality (business); Horizontal effect; Population; Process (engineering); Economic system; Capital (economics),,0

Researchers are paying more and more attention to social innovation beside the classical Schumpeterian approach. Social innovation is new solutions (product, technology, organizational solution) that can effectively meet market needs that are not or hardly met on a market basis, innovation can lead to new or more advanced skills / relationships, and contribute to a more efficient use of resources. However, there is no uniform definition of the concept. The issue of social innovation is particularly important in the case of the Northern Hungary region, because it can bring hope for some peripheral areas and a new approach to solving problems.

To combine acoustic data with visual information in real world settings, spatial correlation must be established. The approach explored in this paper consists of having two robots, each equipped with a microphone array, localizing themselves in a shared reference map using SLAM. Based on their locations, data from the microphone arrays are used to triangulate in 3D the location of a sound source in relation to the same map. This strategy results in a novel cooperative sound mapping approach using mobile microphone arrays. Trials are conducted using two mobile robots localizing a static or a moving sound source to examine in which conditions this is possible. Results suggest that errors under 0.3 m are observed when the relative angle between the two robots are above 30° for a static sound source, while errors under 0.3 m for angles between 40° and 140° are observed with a moving sound source.",Artificial intelligence; Sound (geography); Microphone; Microphone array; Computer vision; Computer science; Simultaneous localization and mapping,,3

Breeding resistant cultivars can effectively and economically control the disease. In the present study, a wheat collection consisting of 100 cultivars from China and 18 improved germplasms from global landrace donors together with 36 known single Lr gene lines were tested with 20 strains of Puccinia triticina Eriks. in the seedling stage to postulate the Lr gene in the cultivars and germplasms. In addition, 12 diagnostic molecular markers specific to 10 Lr genes were used to detect the presence of the Lr genes in the wheat collection. Resistance to leaf rust of these cultivars at the adult plant stage was tested in fields under natural infection during the 2016 to 2018 cropping seasons in Baoding, Hebei Province. The gene postulation combined with molecular marker detection showed that six Lr genes (Lr1, Lr26, Lr33, Lr34, Lr45, and Lr46) were identified in 44 wheat accessions, including 37 cultivars and seven improved germplasms. Among the 44 wheat accessions postulated with Lr genes, Lr1 was present in four accessions, Lr26 in 12 accessions, Lr33 in two accessions, Lr34 in 14 accessions, Lr45 in three accessions, and Lr46 in 16 accessions. In the collection of 118 cultivars/germplasms, 34 wheat lines displayed adult-plant resistance carrying Lr34, Lr46, and/or underdetermined genes. Therefore, a high level of leaf rust resistance can be achieved through the combination of all-stage resistance and adult-plant resistance genes together in wheat cultivars.",Gene; Rust; Horticulture; Cultivar; Seedling; Molecular marker; Wheat leaf rust; Puccinia triticina; Resistance (ecology); Biology,gene postulation; molecular marker; slow-rusting resistance; wheat leaf rust,6

In this study, the Hamilton's principle of dynamics is employed to establish the governing equations for the pipe pile, which is treated as a two-dimensional (2D) hollow bar structure. The outer and inner soil media surrounding the pipe pile are considered as three-dimensional (3D), homogenous, and liquid-saturated porous continuum, besides they are described by the porous-elastic media model proposed by de Boer. The governing equations for the pipe pile and the soils are solved with the aid of the separation technique of variables, and also utilizing the boundary and contact conditions of the pipe pile and the soils. Then, the analytical solution for the vertical dynamic compliance of the pipe pile is derived. By comparing with the existing solutions and finite element model (FEM), the results from the newly proposed method confirm its validation. Comparative analyses of numerical examples are finally conducted to reveal the variations and response principle of the dynamic compliance of the pipe pile under different material/geometry parameters.",Viscoelasticity; Pile; Geotechnical engineering; Porosity; Materials science; Porous medium; Frequency domain; Geology,,2

In order to close this gap, the aim of this study is to determine the effects of technological innovation on both carbon emission and ecological footprint for big emerging markets (BEM) countries. In doing so, the environmental impacts of the financialization process are also explored, in line with the fact that these countries face constraints in financing technological developments. In this context, the effects of technological development, financialization, renewable energy consumption, and non-renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation are examined through the second-generation panel data methods for the period 1995-2016. The findings indicate that technological innovation is effective in reducing carbon emissions, but does not have a significant impact on the ecological footprint, namely a 1% increase in technological innovations reduces carbon emission by 0.082-0.088%. Moreover, it is found that financialization harms environmental quality for both indicators of the environment because a 1% increase in financialization increases carbon emissions by 0.203-0.222% and increases ecological footprint by 0.069-0.071%.",Emerging markets; Economics; Natural resource economics; Environmental degradation; Context (language use); Energy consumption; Financialization; Greenhouse gas; Environmental quality; Ecological footprint,Carbon emission; Ecological footprint; Environmental degradation; Financialization; Panel data; Technological innovation,32

Based on data from 2001 to 2018, the study used an advanced economic methodology for the long-run estimate, the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator, which accounts for heterogeneity in slope parameters and dependencies across countries. The empirical results show that tourism development degrades environmental quality, while technological innovation mitigates carbon emissions. Further, findings show that urbanization increases carbon emissions, while an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between economic growth and environmental degradation, implying the existence of EKC in China.

However, it is crucial to know the factors influencing technological innovation in a green supply chain. Some preconceptions show that technological innovation in a business can be affected by internal and external factors, and therefore there must be correlations between such factors to flourish the technological innovation and, subsequently, the green supply chain. Besides, predicting the technological innovation level in a supply chain can be vital and direct it to the Industry 5.0 goals. In this research, a 3-phased framework will be proposed to predict the Technological Innovation Level of Green Supply Chains. The scope of this research includes Green Investment, Eco-friendly Design and Customer Collaborations. In the 1st phase of the framework, dependent and independent factors considering the scope of the Research will be determined; and then, using statistical data analysis, the weight of factors, which reflects their impact on technological innovation (dependent factor), will be determined. Then, in the 2nd phase, a comprehensive model will be developed and trained. Using the data of supply chains that were gathered in the first phase, the train and test data would be selected. In continuation, the model will be trained and its performance will be evaluated using some metrics. Then, in the last phase (phase 3), the developed model will be used to predict the technological level of supply chains. The outcomes of this research can help top managers of supply chains to predict the level of technological innovation by investing a certain budget in improving the dependent variables. The outcomes demonstrated that Customer Collaboration (0.481), Eco-friendly design (0.419) and Green Investment (0.41) have significant impacts on technological innovation improvement in the studied cases, respectively. Besides, the results showed the superiority of the K-nearest Neighbor algorithm while using the Minkowski distance method and considering 5 neighbors. The findings indicated that the proposed framework could predict Technological Innovation with 0.751 accuracies. The outcomes of this research can be helpful for industry owners to predict the expected technological innovation level of their system by investing a certain budget in green investment, eco-friendly design and customer collaborations in their enterprises.</jats:p>",Supply chain; Scope (computer science); Investment (military); Business; Phase (matter); Industrial organization; Supply chain management; Marketing,,0

Taking China’s Agricultural Listed Companies as an Example,2021-11-23,2021,journal article,Haihua Liu; Peng Wang; Zejun Li,"The effect of digital transformation on enterprise technological innovation is reflected in quantity and quality, which may show heterogeneity. In this regard, this paper uses the data of China’s A-share agricultural listed companies from 2015 to 2020 to compare the differential impact of enterprise digital transformation from the perspective of quantity and quality of technological innovation. Firstly, the Tobit model is used to test whether there are differences in the impact of digital transformation on the quantity and quality of technological innovation of agricultural enterprises, and heterogeneity is tested according to the nature of enterprises. Secondly, this paper explores the reasons digital transformation has different effects on the quantity and quality of technological innovation through mechanism analysis. Finally, according to the threshold model, the conditions for digital transformation to promote the quantity and quality of technological innovation of agricultural enterprises are discussed. The empirical results show that, first, the digital transformation of agricultural enterprises only promotes the number of technological innovations, and there is heterogeneity in the nature of enterprises, but the innovation efficiency is not affected. Second, the period expense rate will lead to digital transformation, having different effects on the quantity and efficiency of technological innovation of agricultural enterprises. Third, the impact of digital transformation on the technological innovation efficiency of agricultural enterprises has a significant single threshold effect, and when the period expense rate is less than the threshold, the digital transformation has a significant role in promotion.",Agriculture; Digital transformation; Business; Tobit model; China; Threshold model; Quality (business); Differential impact; Industrial organization; Promotion (rank),,4

The device consists of an inertial mass electrostatically coupled to an oscillating beam through a gap of 8 $\mu \text{m}$ . The motion of the inertial mass modulates an AC electrostatic field that drives the beam in its non-linear regime. This non-linearity is used to implement machine learning in the mechanical domain, using reservoir computing with delayed feedback to process the acceleration information provided by the inertial mass. The device is microfabricated on a silicon-on-insulator substrate using conventional MEMS processes. Dynamic characterization showed good accelerometer functionalities, with an inertial mass sensitivity on the order of 100 mV/g from 250 to 1300 Hz and a natural frequency of 1.7 kHz. In order to test the device computing capabilities, two different machine learning benchmarks were implemented, with the inputs fed to the device as accelerations. The neuromorphic MEMS accelerometer was able to accurately emulate non-linear autoregressive moving average models and compute the parity of random bit streams. These results were obtained in a test system with a non-trivial transfer function, showing a robustness that is well-suited to anticipated applications.

Ecological efficiency is an important indicator of whether economic efficiency and environmental efficiency are balanced. Exploring ecological efficiency is vital for achieving sustainable development, as technological innovation, industrial structure upgrading, and ecological efficiency are probably related. However, there has been little research on the relationships among them. In this study, we used the super-efficiency slacks-based model (SBM) involving undesirable output to calculate the ecological efficiency of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2017. We found that China's ecological efficiency has risen, fallen, then fluctuated, and that there were significant spatial differences. Then, we used 3 spatial econometric models for comparative analysis, which revealed that the independent effects of technological innovation on ecological efficiency was significant and negative; however, technological innovation demonstrated a strong positive effect in tandem with industrial structure upgrading, and industrial structure always had a positive effect on ecological efficiency. On this basis, we added the cross-item of technological innovation, and industrial-structure upgrades had a significant and positive impact on ecological efficiency, which was significantly greater than the independent effect of technological innovation and industrial-structure upgrades. To explore the mechanism of industrial-structure upgrading and technological innovation on regional ecological efficiency, we set the first 2 as threshold variables. We found that there is in fact a threshold effect of technological innovation and industrial-structure upgrading on ecological efficiency due to the mismatch of periods. These results provide a theoretical rationale for China to formulate strategies to improve ecological efficiency.

In order to enrich the scholarly conversation on the fit between technological innovation and business model innovation, drawing insights from the dynamic capabilities perspective, this paper examines the fit between value proposition innovation and technological innovation (exploitative versus explorative) for the performance of startups in the digital environment. Based on on-site survey data of 285 digital startups in one of the world's largest digital economies, we find that explorative innovation strengthens the positive impact of value proposition innovation on the performance of startups, whereas exploitative innovation weakens this positive effect. Furthermore, these moderating effects are magnified in a highly uncertain demand environment. These findings inject fresh insights into existing scholarly conversation on the fit between technological innovation and business model innovation by offering a dynamic capabilities perspective and by extending it to an increasingly digital business environment.",Business; Order (exchange); Survey data collection; Conversation; Dynamic capabilities; Business model innovation; Digital business; Industrial organization; Value proposition,,4

The origin can be congenital or, more frequently, iatrogenic and the clinical presentation is heterogeneous. Respiratory tract fistulas can lead to severely reduced health-related quality of life and short survival. Therapy mainly relies on endoscopic surgical interventions but patients often require prolonged hospitalization and may develop complications. Therefore, more conservative regenerative medicine approaches, mainly based on lipotransfer, have also been investigated. Adipose tissue can be delivered either as unprocessed tissue, or after enzymatic treatment to derive the cellular stromal vascular fraction. In the current narrative review, we provide an overview of the main tissue/cell-based clinical studies for the management of various types of respiratory tract fistulas or injuries. Clinical experience is limited, as most of the studies were performed on a small number of patients. Albeit a conclusive proof of efficacy cannot be drawn, the reviewed studies suggest that grafting of adipose tissue-derived material may represent a minimally invasive and conservative treatment option, alternative to more aggressive surgical procedures. Knowledge on safety and tolerability acquired in prior studies can lead to the design of future, larger trials that may exploit innovative procedures for tissue processing to further improve the clinical outcome.",Regenerative medicine; Adipose tissue; Intensive care medicine; Fistula; Tracheoesophageal fistula; Tolerability; Respiratory tract; Stromal vascular fraction; Respiratory Tract Fistula; Medicine,Adipose tissue; Airway defects restoration; Fistula; Head and neck; Lipotransfer; Mesenchymal stromal cells; Minimally invasive treatments; Regenerative medicine; Respiratory tract; Tracheoesophageal fistula,6

Scholars and practitioners recognize the importance of technological innovation in a firm's ability to obtain a sustainable competitive advantage. However, the empirical findings on the overarching relationship between technological innovation and firm performance remain inconclusive. Thus, in this article, we attempt to reconcile the mixed empirical results on the relationship by employing a multivariate meta-analytic methodology. We find that technological innovation has a significant and positive impact on a firm's performance. Furthermore, we find empirical support for the moderating influence of cross-cultural and institutional differences on the relationship.

Efficient tracking of food products when within the supply chain ensures the safety of the end consumers. However, today’s food supply chain industry falls short of providing dependable tracing of food products due to a lack of visibility and transparency in tracking the food production, processing, distribution, transportation, and movement when with the supply chain, which poses a serious threat to the quality of processed food and the safety of consumers. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and IoT-based framework to regulate and monitor the processed poultry food supply chain industry’s functioning and improves the safety and quality of food products delivered to end-consumer. Our proposed solution utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to develop a transparent, reliable, and tamper-proof food supply chain framework, and ensure the integrity of supply chain transactions by eliminating a central authority. The smart contract regulates and monitors the transactions between the entities in the network and keeps all of the parties, within the network, well informed about transactions. This proposed aims to identify and eliminate food adulteration and contamination; enhance quality and safety in the food industry’s supply chain, improve the transparency of transactions, and legal culpability, which ultimately has a positive impact on consumer trust and the overall brand value.",Supply chain; Risk analysis (engineering); Brand equity; Transparency (market); Quality (business); Smart contract; Food supply; Computer science; Food industry; Food processing,,3

In comparison to other types of RNAs, the abundance of circRNAs is relatively low but due to the circular configuration, their stability is very high. In addition, circRNAs display high degree of tissue specificity. The sponging activity of circRNAs toward microRNAs is the best-described mode of action of circRNAs. However, the ability of circRNAs to bind with specific proteins, as well as to encode short proteins, propose alternative functions. This review introduces the biogenesis of circRNAs and summarizes the roles played by circRNAs in human diseases. These include examples of their functional roles in several organ-specific cancers, such as head and neck and breast and lung cancers. In addition, we review potential functions of circRNAs in diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a growing number of studies have demonstrated involvement of circRNAs in a wide spectrum of signaling molecular pathways, but at the same time many different and controversial views on circRNAs role and function are emerging. We conclude by offering cellular homeostasis generated by networks comprising circular RNAs, other non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins.

The paper employs series of wavelet tools for datasets covering the period from 1990Q1 to 2015Q4. The empirical outcomes demonstrate proof of the interaction between renewable energy use, economic growth, technological innovation, globalization and CO2 emissions in both time and frequency. The empirical results of the wavelet analyses reveal that globalization, GDP growth, and technological innovation increase CO2 emissions in Japan, while renewable energy usage mitigates CO2 in the short and medium terms. The results demonstrate the significance of implementing policies effectively coordinated by the policymakers to curb the significant environmental degradation in Japan.

Results of this study show that environmental regulation promotes the technological innovation within the Chinese industry and attract greater foreign capital investment. While the influx of capital will furthermore boost technological progress, a benign interaction effect may be observed between technological innovation and foreign capital. The implementation of the new environmental policy will intensify game strategies between managers and enterprises. Enhanced co-ordination activity within industrial organizations will generate more effective organizational and technological innovation, thereby attracting a large flow of FDI, Phase analysis suggests that the policy of market borrowing technologies is more effective. In addition, industry sample results highlight a compensation effect of technological innovation in the raw materials and manufacturing industry, though environmental regulation of high-tech industries will generate an offset effect with respect to technological innovation.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are mutualistic fungi that form a symbiosis with most land plants’ roots, improve their growth, and induce stress tolerance. This paper reports the results obtained using P. vittata inoculated with AMF, to extract Arsenic (As) from an industrial site highly contaminated also by other pollutants. Two experiments have been performed. In the first one, AMF colonized ferns were grown for two years under controlled conditions in soil coming from the metallurgic site. Positive effects on plant health and As phytoextraction and accumulation were detected. Then, considering these results, we performed a three year in situ experiment in the industrial site, to assess the remediation of As at two different depths. Our results show that the colonization of P. vittata with AMF improved the remediation process of As with a significant impact on the depth 0–0.2 m.",Horticulture; Frond; Fern; Pteris vittata; Symbiosis; Arsenic; Environmental remediation; Phytoremediation; Pollutant; Biology,Pteris vittata L.; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; arsenic; phytoremediation,15

Among them, circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a well-represented class characterized by the high sequence conservation and cell type specific expression in eukaryotes. They are covalently closed loops formed through back-splicing. Recently, circRNAs were shown to regulate a variety of cellular processes functioning as miRNA sponges, RBP binding molecules, transcriptional regulators, scaffold for protein translation, as well as immune regulators. A growing number of studies are showing that deregulated expression of circRNAs plays important and decisive actions during the development of several human diseases, including cancer. The research on their biogenesis and on the various molecular mechanisms in which they are involved is going very fast, however, there are still few studies that address their involvement in embryogenesis and eukaryotic development. This review has the intent to describe the most recent progress in the study of the biogenesis and molecular activities of circRNAs providing insightful information in the field of embryogenesis and cell differentiation.

The empirical analyses are evaluated using a battery of estimation techniques comprising augmented mean group (AMG), common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG), and mean group (MG), respectively. The following major results are evident from the analyses. First, coal, gas, fuel, and imports increase co2pc while exports reduce it. Second, the unconditional and conditional effects of technological innovation (ECOI) significantly reduce co2pc. These results are consistent with the robustness checks based on CCEMG and MG estimators.

The building sector in these countries is one of the sectors that increases CO2 emissions significantly. Increasing CO2 emissions in the building sector adversely affects sustainable development. Therefore, measures to mitigate environmental damage become substantially important. Improvements in technological innovation can be among the measures considered to mitigate CO2 emissions. In this study, the effects of technological innovation on the carbon emissions caused by the building sector are examined by panel data methods for the BRICS countries in the period 1992–2018. It has been observed that there is a long-term relationship between the series. As the results of Dynamic Common Correlated Effects indicated, increased technological innovation reduces carbon emissions. This result is meaningful to encourage investments related to technological innovation.",Business; Nexus (standard); Natural resource economics; China; Greenhouse gas; Sustainable development; Panel data,BRICS Countries; Building sector; Carbon emissions; Dynamic common correlated effects; Technological innovation,34

The dynamic features of financial markets and the innovation of complex financial products and services based on new technologies and business models have presented regulators with significant challenges. Specifically, how can regulators effectively scrutinise unprecedentedly large volumes of market data? Is â€˜Regtechâ€™, instruments developed by industry to assist regulators, able to strengthen private compliance with public regulation? Does an alternative approach which institutionalises publicâ€“private cooperation offer answers to these new regulatory challenges? Responding to these questions, we adopt an analytic approach that categorises innovations by the type of regulatory uncertainty they produce. Our findings indicate that different types of uncertainty are driving divergent responses at the national and European levels, leading to a mixture of regulatory trajectories: cooperation and competition, centralisation and fragmentation.",Market data; Financial services; Business; Structure (mathematical logic); Financial market; Emerging technologies; Centralisation; Competition (economics); Industrial organization; Business model,,0

This paper selects the panel data of 12 resource-based industries in China from 2003 to 2019 and tests the impact of environmental regulation on technological innovation of resource-based industries by constructing the econometric model. The results show that environmental regulation can promote the technological innovation of resource-based industries. Specifically, environmental regulation has no significant positive impact on the immediate product innovation of 12 resource-based industries in China, but it has a significant positive impact on the product innovation lagging behind one period and two periods. Environmental regulation has no significant impact on the process innovation of current period, but has a significant positive impact on the process innovation of lagging one period. Industrial scale has a significant positive impact on product innovation of resource-based industries. The input of scientific and technological activity personnel has a significant positive impact on the product innovation of current period, and in the long run, it promotes both product innovation and process innovation. On this basis, this paper puts forward the relevant measures and suggestions for the formulation of environmental regulation policies.

Vorotnikov; A.S. Gorbacheva; I.P. Glebov,"<jats:p>This article reveals the cause-and-effect relationships of the influence of technological innovations on the efficiency of reproduction of fixed assets in the crop production industry. The introduction of innovations is a complex, time-consuming and costly process in agriculture, but, as a rule, without the development of the innovation process in the agricultural sector, the reproduction process will not be effective. The strongest negative impact on the innovation process in agriculture is caused by the low level of effective demand for scientific and technical products. The model of the main stages of the innovation process in agriculture is presented, taking into account logically related stages, namely, from the emergence of an idea to its implementation in specific products and services sold on the agricultural market, and also reflects the emerging financial flows and typical subjects of the innovation process in the industry. The analysis of indicators of net profit and costs for technological innovations of enterprises A and B of the Yekaterinovsky district of the Saratov region is carried out. The correlation analysis carried out between the level of profitability and the costs of technological innovations in crop production of enterprises A and B of the Yekaterinovsky district of the Saratov region allowed us to identify the impact of innovative technologies used in crop production on increasing the level of profitability. The organizational and economic mechanism of reproduction of fixed assets in the crop production industry is considered, which made it possible to identify sources of financing of the reproduction process at enterprises. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the use of innovative technologies in the crop production industry is one of the key reasons that create conditions for expanded reproduction.

Biologically, fatty aldehydes can be produced from fatty acyl-CoA by the action of fatty acyl-CoA reductases. The aldehydes produced can be further converted enzymatically to other valuable derivatives. Thus, metabolic engineering of microorganisms for biosynthesizing aldehydes and their derivatives could provide an economical and sustainable platform for key aldehyde precursor production and subsequent conversion to various value-added chemicals. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent host for this purpose because it is a robust organism that has been used extensively for industrial biochemical production. However, fatty acyl-CoA-dependent aldehyde-forming enzymes expressed in S. cerevisiae thus far have extremely low activities, hence limiting direct utilization of fatty acyl-CoA as substrate for aldehyde biosynthesis. Toward overcoming this challenge, we successfully engineered an alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase for aldehyde production through rational design. We further improved aldehyde production through strain engineering by deleting competing pathways and increasing substrate availability. Subsequently, we demonstrated alkane and alkene production as one of the many possible applications of the aldehyde-producing strain. Overall, by protein engineering of a fatty acyl-CoA reductase to alter its activity and metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae, we generated strains with the highest reported cytosolic aliphatic aldehyde and alkane/alkene production to date in S. cerevisiae from fatty acyl-CoA.",Reductase; Protein engineering; Enzyme; Chemistry; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Aldehyde; Rational design; Biosynthesis; Biochemistry; Metabolic engineering,aldehydes; biofuels; de novo biosynthesis; metabolic engineering; protein engineering; synthetic biology,5

Moreover, formulating a reasonable environmental regulation system and promoting green technological innovation is a systematic way to improve GTFP. However, previous related studies lack to investigate the impact of environmental regulation on GTFP from the perspective of green technological innovation. For this purpose, this paper aims to examine the specific impact of environmental regulation on GTFP based on the perspective of green technology innovation, so as to provide some policy insights for the formulation of more effective implementation of environmental regulation, improve green technology innovation level, and achieve a win-win situation for both economic growth and environmental protection. Furthermore, epsilon-based measure (EBM), which includes both radial and non-radial distance functions, is used to measure the GTFP. The spatial autoregressive method is also employed to quantify the impact of environmental regulation on GTFP from the perspective of green technological innovation using panel data of 269 prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2018. The main findings indicate that there is a significant spatial autocorrelation between environmental regulation and GTFP. Environmental regulation has a significant positive effect on GTFP. Environmental regulation in the local regions also significantly contributes to GTFP in neighboring regions. Besides, environmental regulation indirectly promotes GTFP by enhancing green technological innovation level. Regional heterogeneity results show that environmental regulation can not only directly promote GTFP but also indirectly significantly promote GTFP through green technological innovation in the eastern and central regions, but insignificant in the western region. Based on the above findings, we conclude that policymakers should not only develop differentiated environmental regulation standards and steadily improving the intensity and rationality of environmental regulation but also add green innovation funds supply, enhance green innovation factor allocation efficiency, and strengthen R&D talents, funds, and policies to green technology innovation, so as to drive GTFP improvement.",Porter hypothesis; Productivity; Environmental regulation; Green development; Perspective (graphical); Technical progress; Technological change; Total factor productivity; Environmental economics; Economics; Industrial organization,Environmental regulation; Green technological innovation; Green total factor productivity; Heterogeneity effect; Spatial spillover effect,6

In addition, the gradual shift causality test results disclosed that renewable energy consumption, economic growth, technological innovation and public-private partnership investment in energy can predict consumption-based carbon emissions in Brazil. Therefore, Brazilian policymakers should actively encourage the R&D of low-carbon technologies and renewable energy consumption. Domestic consumption levels, on the other hand, should be targeted, specifically those that are more energy-intensive and cause a rise in CO2 emissions due to consumption.",Consumption (economics); Nexus (standard); Economics; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Environmental degradation; Investment (macroeconomics); Greenhouse gas; Sustainability; General partnership,Brazil; Consumption-based carbon emissions; Renewable energy consumption; Technological innovation,20

At the present stage of development in our country, an adequate and effective holistic system that ensures the smooth functioning of the innovation process has been created. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, apologists for a market economy, unfortunately, were unable to create the necessary institutional conditions that would allow the formation of a holistic model of the innovation process at the micro and macro levels. The evidence of this is the sharp reduction in the number of scientific organizations and experimental design bureaus, the lack of demand for trained highly qualified personnel (engineering, technical), which, in turn, has a serious impact on Russia’s innovative and technological lag behind developed countries. The ability and potential of creating and implementing technological innovations depend on the efficiency of the functioning of financing mechanisms and the state of investment sources that create a favorable economic environment for innovation activity. The paper analyzes and evaluates the structure of financing sources of technological innovations. A comparative analysis of research and development funding in developed countries and Russia is conducted.

It  is  of  particular  importance  in  the  Arctic  zone  of  the Russian Federation, where it can be one of the leading factors in its development, which is due to the importance of the AZRF as a whole. This article is devoted to assessing the relation-ship between investment in technological innovation by organizations and the development of the region’s economy. The following indicators were selected from statistical data and calculated for the implementation of the goal: the growth rate of investments in technological innovations, the  growth  rate  of  gross  regional  product  and  the  labor  productivity  index  for  the  regions  of  the AZRF. The present paper uses a regression-correlation analysis method by which correlation coefficients were calculated between the growth rate of investment in innovation and the growth rate of GRP, between the growth rate of investment in innovation and the productivity index, as well as the significance of their influence on the resulting signs. As a result, the main trends of investment processes in technological innovations in the AZRF from 2008 to 2018 were determined, the unique nature of the impact of investments in technological innovations on economic indicators in each individual region was established. It was also found out that the sectoral orientation of a particular territory does not unambiguously affect the correlation between the parameters under consideration. Based on the information obtained during the study, the author proposed a typology of the AZRF regions on the impact of investments in technological innovations on GRP and labor productivity, demonstrating the strength of both the relationship of these parameters in the region and  the  strength  of  the  regional  economy’s  response to investment growth.</jats:p>",Investment (military); Productivity; Gross Regional Product; Economic geography; Typology; Index (typography); Innovation economics; Economics; Technological change; Industrial organization; Economic system,,0

However, there is a lack of research on the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. To bridge this gap, this study uses the panel data of 115 resource-based cities in China from 2003 to 2016, and uses the dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation method to study the impact of technological innovation and technology introduction on industrial green transformation of resource-based cities. The results show that technology introduction has a negative effect on the industrial green transformation of resource-based cities, while technological innovation can have a positive effect. Meanwhile, technology introduction has imparted a greater role to technological innovation in promoting this transformation. In addition, the interactive effects between technological innovation and technology introduction have obvious heterogeneity on the industrial green transformation of different types of resource-based cities. Therefore, resource-based cities should continue to increase investment in scientific research, to constantly improve and consolidate their technological innovation ability, optimise foreign investment strategy in technology introduction, and strengthen the digestion and absorption of imported technology, while increasing technological innovation, and personnel training.",Transformation (function); Technological change; Business; Resource (biology); China; Investment (macroeconomics); Environmental pollution; Foreign direct investment; Industrial organization; Panel data,,17

However, technological innovation in most cases delivers change that was not anticipated thus evoking arguments of whether entrepreneurial leaders are those driving social change as they seek to remain competitive or whether their technological innovations possess a life of their own. This chapter takes a critical view of this technological dilemma for entrepreneurial innovation and competitiveness. It explores theories of technological determinism, the social shaping of technology, and the social construction of technology as necessary philosophical lenses that we need to re-visit. Consequently, the chapter argues the methodological implications these ontological perspectives pose to entrepreneurship research involving technological innovation and also argues for newer perspectives of approaching the phenomenon.",Neoclassical economics; Sociology; Social change; Emerging technologies; Social shaping of technology; Dilemma; Social construction of technology; Phenomenon; Technological determinism; Entrepreneurship,,0

First, it describes the intensification of mining in the site of Tonso (in the Guinean region of Boure–Sieke, where alluvial mining has been practiced since precolonial times). Generated by the inflow of Burkinabe migrant miners, who brought with them the techniques to “deepen” underground mining and target hard-rock deposits, technological innovations challenged the existing prerogatives of traditional authorities and village committees over gold production, triggering a reconfiguration of their regulatory power. The second case presents the transformations produced by the diffusion of cyanide-based processing techniques in gold sites across western Burkina Faso. The increase in value of residues triggered new claims of ownership by different economic actors and profoundly changed the nature of in-kind and monetary exchange across the whole production chain. A final section discusses the notion of “technological frontier” and the social embeddedness of technological innovations, arguing for a specific attention on how innovations are reproduced and appropriated at the periphery.",Political science; Economic geography; Power (social and political); Value (ethics); Frontier; Socioeconomic change; Gold production; Guinea conakry; Embeddedness; Social anthropology,,5

They encompass a range of different molecular types and subtypes, many of which have a well-defined profile of driver mutations, copy number changes and DNA methylation patterns. A majority of gliomas will require surgical intervention to relieve raised intracranial pressure and reduce tumour burden. A proportion of tumours, however, are located in neurologically sensitive areas and a biopsy poses a significant risk of a deficit. A majority of gliomas recur after surgery, and monitoring tumour burden of the recurrence is currently achieved by imaging. However, most imaging modalities have limitations in assessing tumour burden and infiltration into adjacent brain, and sometimes imaging is unable to discriminate between tumour recurrence and pseudo-progression. Liquid biopsies, obtained from body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood, contain circulating nucleic acids or extracellular vesicles containing tumour-derived components. The studies for this systematic review were selected according to PRISMA criteria, and suggest that the detection of circulating tumour-derived nucleic acids holds great promises as biomarker to aid diagnosis and prognostication by monitoring tumour progression, and thus can be considered a pathway towards personalized medicine.",DNA methylation; Biopsy; Glioma; Liquid biopsy; Cerebrospinal fluid; Personalized medicine; Central nervous system; Bioinformatics; Medicine; Biomarker (medicine),CSF; biomarkers; blood; circulating nucleic acids; glioma; liquid biopsy,0

Specifically, neo-liberal reforms have helped the private sector gain considerable control over the direction and objectives of science and technological progress since the 1980s, while limiting the role of governments in these areas. However, the expanded role of the private sector in modern science and technological innovation has resulted in scientists essentially losing their freedom to choose, as they are largely limited to working on market-oriented research topics and projects. The influence of the private sector has also contributed to making society enormously dependent on technology products and gadgets, which in turn, has played a significant role in facilitating the onset of an impending environmental apocalypse. Ultimately, science is far too important to be left up to corporations to control and manage for the benefit of their narrow and short-sighted objectives.",Private sector; Technological change; Business; Limiting; Control (management); Corporation; Market economy,,0

Taking Chinese pharmaceutical listed companies from 2011 to 2017 as research samples, this paper uses principal component analysis and probit regression model to empirically test the impact of TMT risk preference on technological innovation failure of firms from the perspective of government intervention. It is found that TMT’s risk preference has a significantly positive impact on the failure of firms’ technological innovation. The regulatory role of government intervention between TMT’s risk preference and failure of firms’ technological innovation is an inverted U-shaped relationship. Low or high level of government intervention will promote the positive impact of TMT’s risk preference on the failure of technological innovation, and increase the risk of technological innovation failure. The findings of this study contribute to: (1) broaden the research perspective of technological innovation failure. (2) The innovation failure rate can be reduced by constructing or optimizing the TMT and the government intervening in firm innovation through reasonable and perfect technology innovation guidance policies. (3) expand the research means of innovation failure, making the results more convincing.</jats:p>",Business; Econometrics; Principal component analysis; Preference; Top management; Probit model,,1

Owing to its considerable natural oil and gas resources, Iran has a high potential for the development of these industries. In the value chain process of these God-given resources, a wide diversity of final downstream petrochemical products has a significant charm and scope for technological innovation and development. In the absence of a systematic perspective, all the planning and costs in this field will fail. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design and analyze the dynamic model of technological innovation management in petrochemical downstream industries in Iran. A questionnaire was designed by analyzing the research literature and the opinions of the experts; then, the factors were investigated using verification factor analysis and structural equations with Smart PLS; the final 26 indicators were categorized in four domains including firm, industry, national, and international. Next, using system thinking and Vensim PLE 6.4, the technology innovation management structure was designed in the downstream industries. The behavior of key variables was also predicted for a 7-year time horizon. Finally, it was used to formulate the technology innovation management scenario.",Value chain; Business; Downstream (petroleum industry); Innovation management; Systems thinking; Scope (project management); Time horizon; Industrial organization; Process (engineering); System dynamics,,1

By refining the elements of grain production and scientific and technological innovation, an evaluation system of scientific and technological innovation in grain production is constructed. Firstly, combining linear programming together with the traditional grey synthetic incidence analysis model, a incidence analysis of the scientific and technological innovation indicators of grain production is carried out, and the key and secondary indexes affecting grain outputs are screened by an improved grey incidence analysis model. Secondly, based on DEA-Malmquist index model and taking the grain production process as the research object, the scientific and technological achievement transformation indicators are divided into pre-production, in-production and post-production indicators. The key indicators and secondary indicators of scientific and technological innovation of grain production in various cities of Henan Province from 2010 to 2019 are used to analyze the efficiency of scientific and technological innovation in each stage of grain production. The results show that: (1) The type of basic ability of scientific and technological innovation indicators and the transformation ability of scientific and technological innovation achievements are the major indicators influencing grain outputs, and the investment of basic resources of scientific and technological innovation and the transformation of scientific and technological innovation achievements are the most important to improve grain outputs. (2) In addition, the study reveals that the secondary indicators of the technological innovation efficiency of grain production based on the DEA-Malmquist index model are more efficient than the key indicators in the pre-production, in-production and post-production stages. And there are gaps in the scientific and technological innovation performance of grain production among cities in Henan Province, and the index of technological progress is the leading factor for the gap.</jats:p>",Production (economics); Technological change; Index (typography); Business; Investment (military); Industrial organization,,3

Therefore, while the capital gains the highest profit on the one hand, it also brings together the technologic progress, which is the most basic input of the production process, on the other hand. Technologic progress, which enables the economies of scale to increase and the international market share to expand, also paves the way for the raise of foreign competitive advantages. In this context, the main motivation of this paper is to examine the linkage between financial development, technological innovation and market share in the context of the Schumpeterian Revolution using canonical correlation analysis for 16 emerging market countries in the year of 2015. The results of the canonic correlation coefficients and canonic cross loading correlations point out that there are strong correlation relations between the canonical variable groups of financial development, technological innovation and market share. In this context, it is observed that the original variables that contribute the most to canonical variables of financial development, technological innovation and market share are the domestic credit level, R&D expenditures and product concentration level, respectively. Therefore, the results of the analysis showing that the Schumpeterian Revolution is valid reflect the importance of finance-technology-market share nexus in emerging market economies.",Emerging markets; Market share; Economics; Order (exchange); Profit (accounting); Context (language use); Economies of scale; Product (business); Economic system; Capital (economics),,0

SMEs that have been operating for at least five years were chosen purposively as samples. Based on the requirement, there are 277 entities used in this study. A focus group discussion (FGD) was also conducted to formulate SME models and development strategies in technological innovation. In addition, in-depth interviews and observations were also carried out on technological innovations undertaken by respondents.,It was found that there are five inhibiting factors of SMEs’ technology innovation: government support, quality of human resources, funding of technological innovation, economic conditions and business partners. The biggest inhibiting factor remains to be the funding of technological innovation. Therefore SMEs provide independent technological innovation costs to develop technological innovations for business sustainability. Supporting institutions for developing SME technology innovation consist of government institutions, private institutions, financial institutions (banks) and nonbank financial institutions. To survive and excel amid competition, SMEs need to pay attention to technological innovation. The business strategy that needs to be done is to improve services to consumers and improve their attitude toward innovation in the implementation and development of SMEs’ businesses.,This research is limited to research on the inhibiting factors for SME technology innovation from the aspect of the production sector. This research has not studied various business fields in the trade, service and digital SME sectors.

Water leakage due to pipes’ damage may result in a considerable financial loss and huge water waste. This is furtherly accentuated in countries like United Arab Emirates, where the water supply relies heavily on sea water desalination and where the very high temperature (may exceed 40°C) adds an extra parameter causing pipes damage and cracking. Manual monitoring and checkup of the pipe-grid may be tedious, time consuming, of limited coverage, and may not detect all the issues in a timely efficient manner. Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN) present a compelling alternative, especially with the advent in WSN and WUSN technologies and the variety of events that can be detected. In this paper, we propose a WUSN-based architecture for the autonomous detection and reporting of water leakage and contamination, along with the exact location of the incident. The architecture also provides means to take necessary ‘first-aid’ actions to limit the damage (e.g. close the water valve right before the incident location).

However, there is a scarcity of research exploring the potential of emission reduction components by using econometric approaches. Thus, the present study investigated the role of economic growth, fossil fuel energy use, renewable energy use, technological innovation, agricultural productivity, and forested area to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing carbon dioxide emissions in Indonesia. Time series data from 1990 to 2020 were utilized by applying the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method. The empirical findings revealed that a 1% increase in economic growth and fossil fuel energy use will increase carbon dioxide emissions by 0.36% and 0.67% in Indonesia. Conversely, a 1% increase in renewable energy use, technological innovation, agricultural productivity, and the forested area may lead to carbon dioxide emissions reduction by 0.11%, 0.07%, 0.24%, and 2.87%, respectively in the long run. This article put forward policy recommendations in the areas of low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy use, financing technological innovation, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable forest management which would ensure environmental sustainability by reducing emissions in Indonesia. • This study investigates the potential of emission reduction components in Indonesia. • Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method has been applied by using time series data. • The findings shed new light on renewable energy, technological innovation, agriculture, and forests to reduce emissions. • This article provides policy recommendations for sustainable development by reducing emissions.",Renewable energy; Sustainability; Natural resource economics; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas; Fossil fuel; Global warming; Agriculture; Productivity; Green growth; Economics,,2

Prior research has focused on studying the facility location, inventory management, and route optimization of the supply chain by using certain parameters and models. Nevertheless, uncertainty, as a vital influence factor, greatly affects the supply chain. As such, the uncertainty that comes with technological innovation has a heightened influence on the supply chain. Few studies have explicitly investigated the influence of technological innovation on the anti-epidemic supply chain under the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the current research aims to investigate the influences of the uncertainty caused by technological innovation on the supply chain from demand and supply, shortage penalty, and budget. This paper presents a three-level model of the anti-epidemic supply chain under technological innovation and employs an interval data robust optimization to tackle the uncertainties of the model. The findings are obtained as follows. Firstly, the shortage penalty will increase the costs of the objective function but effectively improve demand satisfaction. Secondly, if the shortage penalty is sufficiently large, the minimum demand satisfaction rate can ensure a fair distribution of materials among the affected areas. Thirdly, technological innovation can reduce costs. The technological innovation related to the transportation costs of the anti-epidemic material distribution center has a greater influence on the optimal value. Meanwhile, the technological innovation related to the transportation costs of the supplier has the least influence. Fourthly, both supply and demand uncertainty can influence costs, but demand uncertainty has a greater influence. Fifthly, the multi-scenario budgeting approach can decrease the calculation complexity. These findings provide theoretical support for anti-epidemic dispatchers to adjust the conservativeness of uncertain parameters under the influence of technological innovation.",Supply chain; Technological change; Economic shortage; Industrial organization; Business; Distribution (mathematics); Supply and demand; Economics,Anti-epidemic supply chain; COVID-19 pandemic; Robust optimization model; Technological innovation,0

The possible negative correlation between financial risks and carbon emissions will cause policy makers to face a dilemma when formulating carbon neutral policies. Therefore, it is crucial to find a middle path that can control financial risks while addressing carbon emission reduction, which can help achieve the dual goals of stable economic development and environmental protection. This empirical research studies the linear and non-linear relationships between financial risk and carbon emissions in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, using a panel fixed effects model and a panel threshold regression model. The study further investigates the role of technological innovation and renewable energy consumption in the risk-emission relationship. Key results were as follows. First, the fixed effects model results verify that financial risk has a negative impact on carbon emissions. This relationship may be influenced by technological innovation and energy transition. Second, there is a significant single-threshold effect between financial risk and carbon emissions. When research and development (R&D) expenditures and renewable energy consumption exceed the threshold, there is a significant decrease in the contribution of financial stability to carbon emissions. Third, the slow growth of technological innovation in OECD countries compared to renewable energy consumption highlights that the potential of technological innovation for carbon reduction needs to be further explored. These empirical findings indicate that encouraging technological innovation and accelerating energy transitions would be productive new ways of thinking about the trade-off between controlling financial risk and carbon emission reduction.",Renewable energy; Economics; Panel data; Consumption (sociology); Energy consumption; Technological change; Natural resource economics; Dilemma; Greenhouse gas; Financial innovation; Business; Environmental economics,Carbon emission; Financial risk; Renewable energy; Threshold panel data,4

Statistical information such as indices and indicators of economy state and development in the regions of the Russian Federation for 2011-2018 was used for assessment. It is safe to conclude that the level of gross regional product is most influenced by the expenditures on research and development; the volume of sales of innovative goods, works, services, turnover of small enterprises; the share of small enterprises that implemented technological innovations; the cost of technological innovations of small enterprises. The efficiency of regional economy depends on the total efficiency of all its economic entities. It is important to ensure the productivity of small businesses and their contribution to the gross regional product in relative terms at a level not lower than that of the average or the large businesses.",Business; Productivity; Gross Regional Product; State (polity); Small business; Total efficiency; Russian federation; Industrial organization,,3

The existing literature has been divided on whether environmental regulation promotes or inhibits industrial development. Can the innovation-driven strategy proposed by China achieve a win-win situation for both? This paper attempts to investigate the technology innovation of China’s three major economic zones in dual environmental regulation effect on industrial structure upgrade. The research was conducted based on Intermediary Effect Model and employing the technique of Image Analysis, panel data of 30 Chinese provincial from in 2005 to 2017 were selected and analyzed. The results demonstrate that the direct effect of formal environmental regulations (ER) on industrial upgrading is an inverted “U” shape, and it is positively affecting industrial upgrading through technological innovation strategies. However, the mediating role of technological innovation under the informal environmental regulation (IER) is negative. The effect of the innovation-driven strategy has regional heterogeneity, and marketization is conducive to industrial upgrading, but increasing dependence on foreign trade is not conducive to industrial upgrading. The research above politically suggests that China should further strengthen formal and informal environmental regulations, the informal environmental regulation system should be improved, and feedback mechanisms such as laws should be established. Meanwhile, the government should carry out innovation-driven strategies based on local conditions, improve the innovation mechanism, and enhance the diffusion of technological innovation.",Dividend; Business; Government; Dual (category theory); China; Marketization; Upgrade; Special economic zone; Environmental protection; Panel data,Formal environmental regulation; Industrial upgrading; Informal environmental regulation; Mediation effect; Technological innovation,20

The study presented the first step towards a systematic and theoretical approach in understanding the patient satisfaction. To achieve this, the theory synthesizing and model approaches are adopted. Self-administrated questionnaires will be used to gather data. The findings highlighted that healthcare establishments need to focus on technology-based services due to the decreasing level of satisfaction when population rises. In order to cope with this issue, technological based management system and equipment’s need to be introduced to enhance the operational performance of hospitals, which reduces the delays in treatment and ease the burden of practitioners. The strategy also brings improvement in patient care services and higher level of trust towards hospitals. The study also benefits scholars and open a new avenue for researchers and academia. The paper concluded that appropriate measuring protocols such as technology acceptance model (TAM) and technology readiness model (TRM) need to be incorporated to effectively gauge the effectiveness of the organizational performance and patient satisfaction in the light of technological innovation.&#x0D;; Keywords: Technological innovation, Operational performance, Patients satisfaction</jats:p>",Physics; Process management; Patient satisfaction; Operational performance,,0

In the first part, I describe three of the most frequent answers to the question of why is it necessary, important, or urgent for technological innovation to be incorporated into law schools? The first two answers are directly related to agents of the market that demand legal education: law students and law firms. On the one hand, the legal literature that deals with this issue argues that law schools must innovate in technological matters to meet the expectations and needs of the new generations of law students. On the other hand, the literature argues that this aim should be achieved to satisfy the expectations and needs of law firms, who are the ones that hire new law school graduates. The third response indicates that technological innovation in law schools is necessary because it allows students to achieve learning objectives more effectively. In the second part, I offer a critique of the first two answers, those that react and want to meet the needs both of the legal services market and the educational services market. This critique is based on a Heideggerian interpretation of technology. In the third part, I present my critiques of the third answer, which closely connects the pedagogical aims of legal education and technological innovation. In this section of the essay I argue that the third answer (i) is weakened by the naturalistic fallacy; (ii) it does not support empirically its conclusions, or at least does not support them sufficiently, and it presents some of its empirical arguments as absolute, when there is no consensus in the legal, scientific, or pedagogical communities around them; (iii) it does not offer precise and detailed arguments that show how technological innovation may allow us to fulfill the objectives that legal education usually pursues; and (iv) it obscures the connection between technology and power in legal education.",Political science; Law and economics; Power (social and political); Absolute (philosophy); Naturalistic fallacy; Legal service; Legal education; Interpretation (philosophy),,0

To examine the stationarity of variables containing structural breaks, both sharp and smooth, we employ the novel unit root test (SOR). We likewise use the bootstrap ARDL bounds test method to check the existence of cointegration between CO2 and its determinants. The empirical results emphasize that CO2 emissions, FDI, urbanization, energy consumption, industrialization, technological innovation, and economic growth, are cointegrated in a long-run linkage. Furthermore, we reveal an inverted-U relationship between CO2 emissions and urbanization. Industrialization, real GDP, and energy consumption degrade the environment. FDI inflows and technological innovation affect insignificantly CO2 emissions, while the interplay between FDI inflows and technological innovation improve significantly the environment in Tunisia. The vector error correction model supports the feedback hypothesis between CO2 emissions and its components.

(1) There is significant variation in overall technological innovation efficiency of listed companies in the internet industry, and there is a downward trend. The technological innovation efficiency of business that use financing innovation methods is higher than those that do not. (2) The number of patents and intangible capital investment of internet businesses increase obviously every year, but there is no corresponding increase in the efficiency of technological innovation, and little intangible capital investment of non-financing innovation businesses.

It prescribes that interventions should be focused on alleviating systemic problems that cause unsatisfactory system performance. Although literature provides guidelines to identify systemic problems and formulate options for intervention, the framework is less developed in relation to choosing between these intervention options and deciding on how to combine them into a coherent set. Inspiration is found from a ranking that relates to the concept of leverage points from System Dynamics. After an exploration of conceptual links between the TIS and System Dynamics frameworks, a modified ranking for the TIS-framework is proposed. The proposed ranking may inform the choice between different types of intervention options for a TIS and for creating coherent intervention sets. This is illustrated by discussing two intervention sets aimed to improve the energy-efficiency of existing houses in the Netherlands.",Risk analysis (engineering); Conceptual framework; Leverage (statistics); Psychological intervention; Computer science; Systemic problem; System dynamics,,5

As part of the continual efforts to develop greener alternatives to conventional approaches of e-waste recycling, biologically assisted degradation of e-waste offers a promising recourse by capitalising on certain microorganisms' innate ability to interact with metals or degrade plastics. By harnessing emerging genetic tools in synthetic biology, the evolution of novel or enhanced capabilities needed to advance bioremediation and resource recovery could be potentially accelerated by improving enzyme catalytic abilities, modifying substrate specificities, and increasing toxicity tolerance. Yet, the management of e-waste presents formidable challenges due to its massive volume, high component complexity, and associated toxicity.

Previous research has revealed both positive and negative consequences of technological innovation on the environment. Moreover, most researchers have used linear approaches to explore this connection, which can result in spurious outcomes when nonlinearities exist in the data. According to this background, this research utilizes asymmetric ARDL and spectral causality approaches to assess the asymmetric connection between technological innovation and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Sweden utilizing data from 1980 to 2018. In addition, the disaggregated asymmetric effects of technological innovation (patent resident and patent nonresident) on CO<sub>2</sub> are also captured in this study. The Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed lag (NARDL) results showed that positive (negative) shocks in economic growth enhance environmental quality in Sweden. Furthermore, a positive (negative) shock in technological innovation causes a decrease (increase) in CO<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, a positive (negative) shock in patent nonresident and residents leads to a decrease (increase) in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Sweden. The outcomes from the spectral causality revealed that in the medium and long term, aggregate and disaggregate technological innovation can predict CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Sweden. This study has significant policy implications for policymakers and the government in Sweden.

Previous studies have focused on exploring the linear relationship between intellectual capital and technological innovation, ignoring the possibility of a non-linear relationship between them. This study draws on a dualistic view of intellectual capital and divides it into two elements: human capital and structural capital. Based on the factor endowment theory, we explored the non-linear relationship between intellectual capital and technological innovation, using the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2014 to 2019 as the sample, and then analyzed the moderating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on their relationship. The results of the OLS regressions indicated a significant U-shaped relationship between intellectual capital and its elements on technological innovation. This means a “regressive” effect of low levels of intellectual capital on technological innovation and an “incremental” effect of high levels of intellectual capital on technological innovation. Improving CSR could positively enhance the U-shaped effect of intellectual capital on technological innovation. A further study found that the U-shaped effects of intellectual capital and human capital on technological innovation were still supported in state-owned and private enterprises. The U-shaped effect of structural capital on technological innovation was still supported in private enterprises but not in state-owned enterprises. This study explored the relationship between intellectual capital and technological innovation from a unique perspective.

The findings obtained from Toda-Yamamoto approach reveal the existence of bi-directional causal relation between environmental degradation and economic growth. Also, environmental degradation causes technological innovation and financial development causes environmental degradation and economic growth. Thus, several policy implications should be suggested to policymakers as enhancing the development of technological innovation especially in renewable energy sector to improve environmental quality.",Alternative energy; Cointegration; Distributed lag; Economics; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Environmental degradation; Sustainable development; Stock (geology); Environmental quality,ARDL; Carbon dioxide emissions; Clean energy sources; DOLS; Economic growth; Egypt; FMOLS; Financial development; Technological innovation; Toda-Yamamoto,55

The questions of how systemic innovations or changes in socio-technical systems are implemented and in what form the principles and mechanisms of macro-strategic management of them can be organized are very relevant. Equally relevant is the issue of ensuring the inflow of resources for technological development, such as public funding or private capital. <jats:bold>The aim</jats:bold> of the article is to study a new model for the implementation of innovations in socio-technical systems based on a system dynamics approach. The author applies <jats:bold>methods</jats:bold> of a systematic approach to the analysis of economic processes and phenomena, methods of statistical and econometric analysis, methods of grouping and classification, economic and mathematical modeling, methods of comparative historical and cross-country analysis, forecasting methods and expert judgments. The article examines the methodological principles and mechanisms of macro-strategic management of the dynamics of technological innovation systems and ensuring their financial support. The author proposes a new methodological approach based on system dynamics, which combines two modern concepts of technological innovation systems management: the concept of “innovation engines”, based on the research on new technological innovation systems, and the concept of a “three-vector transition module”. A model of the emergence or decline of technological innovation systems in the context of various transitional processes (changes) in socio-technical systems is identified. <jats:bold>The scientific novelty</jats:bold> of the research lies in the development of new and improvement of the key methodological approaches currently used for the strategic management of the dynamics of technological innovation systems. <jats:bold>The conclusions</jats:bold> of the article show that the new methodological approach proposed by the author provides an important first step towards the study of more formalized models for studying the dynamics of technological innovation systems.</jats:p>",Context (archaeology); Management science; Technological change; Macro; Innovation management; Computer science; Novelty; System dynamics; Knowledge management; Process management,,0

Technological innovation decision-making is a complex and dynamic system, which is affected by various factors inside and outside an enterprise. In this dynamic system, how to make the optimal technological innovation investment decisions is a key concern for enterprises and governments. As an investment activity, technological innovation largely depends on the amount of external financing obtained by enterprises. However, financial constraints have increasingly become an obstacle to enterprises’ technological innovation. At the same time, technological innovation is also affected by the external political and economic environment, such as changes in economic policy, government subsidy policies, and institutional environmental policies. Can these external environments reduce the negative impact of financing constraints on technological innovation? In this study, based on the data of listed companies in China’s strategic emerging industries, we adopt a panel negative binomial regression model to investigate the complexity of technological innovation decision-making from the perspective of financing constraints. Our main findings include the following. First, financing constraints significantly inhibit the input and output of technological innovation in emerging industries. Second, the inhibition effect on the output of substantive innovations is more pronounced than that on the output of strategic innovations. Third, based on the analysis of enterprise heterogeneity in different dimensions, we show that this inhibition has a selective effect among different industries. Finally, we show that economic policy and marketization can help alleviate the inhibition effect of financing constraints on technological innovation.",Business; Marketization; Investment (macroeconomics); Obstacle; Economic recovery; External financing; Investment decisions; Industrial organization; Subsidy; Politics,,1

In this work, a new multi-residue analytical method was developed and validated for the determination of 10 pharmaceuticals in wastewaters using online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The compounds included in the method were antineoplastics (cabazitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, irinotecan, methotrexate, paclitaxel, and topotecan), renin inhibitors (aliskiren), and antidepressants (maprotiline). The method was developed through several experiments on four online SPE cartridges, three reversed phase chromatography columns, and four combinations of mobile phase components. Under optimal conditions, very low limits of detection (LODs) of 1.30 to 10.6 ng L<sup>-1</sup> were obtained. The method was repeatable, with relative standard deviations (RSD, %) for intraday and interday precisions ranged from 1.6 to 7.8 and from 3.3 to 13.2, respectively. Recovery values ranged from 78.4 to 111.4%, indicating the reproducibility of the method. Matrix effects were mainly presented as signal suppression, with topotecan and doxorubicin being the two most affected compounds (31.0% signal suppression). The proposed method was successfully applied to hospital effluents, detecting methotrexate (4.7-9.3 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) and maprotiline (11.2-23.1 ng L<sup>-1</sup>). Due to the shorter overall run time of 15 min, including sample preparation, and reduced sample volume (0.9 mL), this on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS method was extremely convenient and efficient in comparison to the classical off-line SPE method. The proposed method was also highly sensitive and can be used for ultratrace quantification of the studied pharmaceuticals in wastewaters, providing useful data for effective environmental monitoring.",Chromatography; Chemistry; Solid phase extraction; Detection limit; Etoposide; Sample preparation; Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry,LC-MS/MS; anticancer drugs; antidepressant; antineoplastic agents; method validation; online SPE; pharmaceuticals; renin inhibitor; wastewater,0

Here, we present an enzymatic homology-based DNA assembly method, SENAX (Stellar ExoNuclease Assembly miX), that can efficiently assemble multiple DNA fragments at ambient temperature from 30 to 37 °C and requires homology overlap as short as 12-18 base pairs. SENAX relies only on a 3'-5' exonuclease, XthA (ExoIII), followed by Escherichia coli transformation, enabling easy scaling up and optimization. Importantly, SENAX can efficiently assemble short fragments down to 70 bp into a vector, overcoming a key shortcoming of existing commonly used homology-based technologies. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been reported elsewhere using homology-based methods. This advantage leads us to develop a framework to perform DNA assembly in a more modular manner using reusable promoter-RBS short fragments, simplifying the construction process and reducing the cost of DNA synthesis. This approach enables commonly used short bioparts (e.g., promoter, RBS, insulator, terminator) to be reused by the direct assembly of these parts into intermediate constructs.

Evidence from China,2021-07-07,2021,journal article,Long Cheng; Shiyuan Zhang; Xuming Lou; Jie Huang; Fangping Rao; Rui Bai,"Agricultural technology is key to ensuring food security. Innovation in agricultural technology plays a vital role in increasing national food production. Collaborative innovation has become an essential form of technological innovation in the new era. Although there has been a large body of literature exploring the influencing factors on technological innovation, how tie strength dispersion within inter-organizational networks affects agricultural technological innovation has not been systematically studied. In this research, we use a cooperative network to investigate how relational divisive faultlines caused by the uneven distribution of the strength of inter-organizational relationships affects agricultural technological innovation through the subgroup structure, and the moderating role of position embeddedness. This article uses the Derwent Innovations Index to select agricultural technology joint patent applications from 2000 to 2018 to build a cooperation network, and uses multiple linear regression to conduct an empirical analysis. The empirical results show that the relational divisive faultlines have a positive effect on the subgroup structure. There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the subgroup structure and agricultural technological innovation. The initial stage of subgroup formation can transmit the information between the subgroups in time and promote the efficiency of agricultural technological innovation. However, as the degree of subgroup cohesion increases, the phenomenon of “in-group” and “out-of-group” will be formed, which will inhibit information exchange, having a negative impact on agricultural technological innovation. In addition, positional embeddedness has a significant positive moderating effect between relational divisive faultlines and agricultural technological innovation. This research provides a theoretical basis for understanding how the overall network relationship strength distribution affects technological innovation by exploring the micro-process of the structural changes of the cooperation network. Moreover, it has specific guiding significance for the organization to participation in a cooperation network to improve the efficiency of agricultural technological innovation.",Agriculture; Cohesion (computer science); Business; Information exchange; Position (finance); Distribution (economics); Industrial organization; Agricultural machinery; Food security; Embeddedness,,1

This thesis uses the modified Super-SBM method to measure China’s total-factor energy efficiency and then uses the dynamic spatial panel model (DSPM) to verify the effect of industrial structure and technological innovation on total-factor energy efficiency. The study found that from 2003 to 2016, China’s total-factor energy efficiency showed a fluctuating trend of “falling first and then rising.” The inflection point appeared in 2012; total-factor energy efficiency in the Eastern region was significantly higher than the national average, while in the Central and Western regions, it was significantly lower. The results of the analysis show that both the service adjustment of the inter-industry structure and the productivity growth of the intra-industry structure significantly promote improvements in total-factor energy efficiency. However, due to the low conversion rate of scientific and technological achievements in China, the impact of technological innovation input on total-factor energy efficiency is not significant. This is in contradistinction to technological innovation output which does significantly improve total-factor energy efficiency.

We have recently demonstrated that Che-1 is able to promote cell proliferation by sustaining global histone acetylation in multiple myeloma (MM) cells where it interacts with histone proteins and competes with HDAC class I members for binding. Site-directed Mutagenesis was performed to generate a Che-1 mutant (Che-1 3S) lacking three serine residues (Ser316, Ser320 and Ser321) in 308–325 aa region. Western blot experiments were conducted to examine the effect of depletion or over-expression of Che-1 and Che-1 3S mutant on histone acetylation, in different human cancer cell lines. Proliferation assays were assessed to estimate the change in cells number when Che-1 was over-expressed or deleted. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed to evaluate Che-1/histone H3 interaction when Ser316, Ser320 and Ser321 were removed. The involvement of CK2 kinase in Che-1 phosphorylation at these residues was analysed by in vitro kinase, 2D gel electrophoresis assays and mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we confirmed that Che-1 depletion reduces cell proliferation with a concomitant general histone deacetylation in several tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we provided evidence that CK2 protein kinase phosphorylates Che-1 at Ser316, Ser320 and Ser321 and that these modifications are required for Che-1/histone H3 binding. These results improve our understanding onto the mechanisms by which Che-1 regulates histone acetylation and cell proliferation. Che-1 phosphorylation at Ser316, Ser320 and Ser321 by CK2 promotes the interaction with histone H3 and represents an essential requirement for Che-1 pro-proliferative ability.",Acetylation; Phosphorylation; Kinase; Chemistry; Histone H3; Binding protein; Cell growth; Histone; Cell biology; Protein kinase A,CK2; Cancer cells; Cell proliferation; Che-1; Histone acetylation; Phosphorylation; SV40 LT,3

Swart,"This article explores the relation between innovation and resources that are governed as commons by looking at the governance of potato genetic resources, especially in the context of the emergence of hybrid diploid potato breeding that will enable potato propagation through true seeds. As a new breeding tool, hybrid diploid potato breeding may not only revolutionize traditional potato breeding practices, it may also strongly affect current governance modes of potato genetic resources as a commons. Contrary to conventional accounts of the commons that treat technological innovation mainly as an exogenous factor, we argue that technological innovation can better be understood as an endogenous factor. In particular, we develop a co-production framework of innovation and the commons that draws attention to the different ways in which innovation, commons and its governance interact. Using this framework, we demonstrate that the constitution of potato genetic resources as a commons cannot be understood without considering the various ways in which technological innovation affects resources and mediate how these are governed. While reversely, technological innovations themselves are also enabled and constrained by users who govern potato genetic resources as a shared resource. We argue that changes in the governance of genetic resources can be understood as a change from one socio-technical constellation to another, whereby innovations, resources, and institutions are continuously co-produced.",Business; Development studies; Constitution; Context (language use); Corporate governance; Industrial organization; Commons; Shared resource; Sustainable development; Environmental sociology,,3
055-022-064-162-934,miR-15/107 microRNA Gene Group: Characteristics and Functional Implications in Cancer.,2020-06-17,2020,journal article,Chiara Turco; Sara Donzelli; Giulia Fontemaggi,"The miR-15/107 group of microRNAs (miRNAs) encloses 10 annotated human members and is defined based on the presence of the sequence AGCAGC near the mature miRNAs' 5' end. Members of the miR-15/107 group expressed in humans are highly evolutionarily conserved, and seven of these miRNAs are widespread in vertebrate species. Contrary to the majority of miRNAs, which recognize complementary sequences on the 3'UTR region, some members of the miR-15/107 group are peculiarly characterized by the ability to target the coding sequence (CDS) of their target mRNAs, inhibiting translation without strongly affecting their mRNA levels. There is compelling evidence that different members of the miR-15/107 group regulate overlapping lists of mRNA targets but also show target specificity. The ubiquitously expressed miR-15/107 gene group controls several human cellular pathways, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism, and might be altered in various diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Intriguingly, despite sharing the same seed sequence, different members of this family of miRNAs may behave as oncomiRs or as tumor suppressor miRNAs in the context of cancer cells. This review discusses the regulation and functional contribution of the miR-15/107 group to the control of gene expression. Moreover, we particularly focus on the contribution of specific miR-15/107 group members as tumor suppressors in breast cancer, reviewing literature reporting their ability to function as major controllers of a variety of cell pathways and to act as powerful biomarkers in this disease.",Gene; Cancer; microRNA; Translation (biology); Gene expression; Context (language use); MicroRNA Gene; Genetics; Biology; Coding region,Granulin (GRN); miR-107; miR-15; miR-15/107; miR-16; miR-195; miR-497; miR-503,16

Multivalence endows the cage with thermodynamic stability in water. Despite its triscationic nature, the cage is able to use its trisimino residue to coordinate a silver cation. As a comparison, other cations lead to cage decomposition or no coordination. The cage and Ag<sup>+</sup>-coordinated complex were both characterized and confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and theoretical calculations. The metal-ligand complex exhibits a pale-yellow color that can be detectable by the naked eye. The Ag<sup>+</sup>-coordinated complex undergoes decoordination upon the addition of NaCl, during which the cage containing imine bonds remains intact.

The basic principle of the cost prediction model is based on an extended belief rule-based (EBRB) system to model the input-output relationship in investment planning, and a parameter learning model to improve the accuracy of the EBRB system. Additionally, the technological innovation factors are also embedded in the cost prediction model to investigate the influence of technology-related outcomes on investment planning. Finally, based on the data of environmental governance in China’s transportation industry from 2003 to 2016, the cost of transportation industry environmental management in China’s thirty provinces from 2017 to 2033 is predicted under the constraints of technological innovation. Results show that: (1) the accuracy of the proposed cost prediction model is higher than some existing cost prediction methods; (2) the predicted environmental governance costs have a significant regional difference; (3) the upgrading of technological innovation is conducive to saving the future environmental governance costs of the transportation industry in some provinces. In addition to the above results, the present study provides model supports and policy references for government decision makers in transportation industry-related environmental cost planning.",Environmental economics; Business; Government; Input/output (C++); Order (exchange); Standardization; Environmental governance in China; Environmental governance; Flexibility (engineering); Cost prediction,,4

The developed approach is based on the well known Maxwell’s Equations. The proposed problem is solved by means of the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The utilization of BEM allows to introduce the geometry and electrical characteristics of the enclosure in a uniform soil. Therefore, a more realistic approximation of the soil structure is achieved. This formulation allows to obtain the main parameters of these protection systems (the grid resistance, the Ground Potential Rise, and the step and mesh voltage). It also allows to compute the surface and step voltage distributions. In addition, as a secondary result, the voltage and current density distributions over the enclosure are obtained. Finally, two grounding system analyses of real underground electrical substations are presented to demonstrate the industrial application and the modelization capabilities of the proposed formulation.",Voltage; Ground; Grid; Surface (mathematics); Computer science; Numerical analysis; Boundary element method; Mechanical engineering; Earthing system; Enclosure,,1

Che-1/AATF (Che-1) is an RNA binding protein involved in transcription regulation and is highly expressed in this malignancy. Here we experimentally show that Che-1 interacts with paraspeckle components, including the lncRNA NEAT1_2 (NEAT1), which serves as the seed for the maintenance of these structures. Che-1 and NEAT1 localize on R-loops, three-stranded RNA:DNA hybrids structures involved in DNA transcription and repair. Depletion of Che-1 produces a marked accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids sustaining activation of a systemic inflammatory response. We provide evidence that high levels of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in MM cells induces RNA:DNA hybrids and an interferon (IFN) gene signature. We found that MM patients exhibit elevated R-loops levels and paraspeckle genes mRNAs increase linearly to MM progression. Strikingly, patients showing elevated IFN genes signature are associated with a marked poor prognosis. Overall, these findings delineate that elevated R-loops accumulation and inflammatory signaling may contribute to MM progression and that Che-1/NEAT1 plays an essential role in maintaining R-loops homeostasis by preventing excessive inflammatory signaling.",Gene; Chemistry; Transcriptional regulation; Interferon; Paraspeckle; Paraspeckles; RNA-binding protein; DNA; RNA; Cell biology,,0

We report improved biosensing of <i>L. pneumophila</i> with a digital photocorrosion (DIP) biosensor functionalized with an innovative structure of cysteine-modified warnericin antimicrobial peptides for capturing bacteria that are subsequently decorated with anti-<i>L. pneumophila</i> polyclonal antibodies (pAbs). The application of peptides for the operation of a biosensing device was enabled by the higher bacterial-capture efficiency of peptides compared to other traditional ligands, such as those based on antibodies or aptamers. At the same time, the significantly stronger affinity of pAbs decorating the <i>L. pneumophila</i> serogroup-1 (SG-1) compared to serogroup-5 (SG-5) allowed for the selective detection of <i>L. pneumophila</i> SG-1 at 50 CFU/mL. The results suggest that the attractive sensitivity of the investigated sandwich method is related to the flow of an extra electric charge between the pAb and a charge-sensing DIP biosensor.

Considering the impact of energy consumption and environmental pollution on the technological innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises, this paper incorporates industrial energy consumption, pollution control, and wastewater and exhaust emissions into the technical inefficiency equation. Based on the panel data of industrial enterprises in 30 provinces and autonomous regions in China from 2009 to 2016, the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model is used to study the effect of energy consumption and environmental pollution on technological innovation efficiency of industrial enterprises. The research results show that reducing energy consumption and increasing pollution treatment investment both have a significant driving effect on the improvement of industrial enterprises’ technological innovation efficiency. Industrial wastewater and exhaust emissions have the opposite effect; unreasonable input mode of pollution control and personnel allocation have hindered the improvement of industrial enterprises’ technological innovation efficiency. The average annual trend of technological innovation efficiency in industrial enterprises shows a curve of first rising, then falling, and rising again. The average values of Chongqing, Zhejiang, and Hunan rank in the top three, and the average values of Qinghai, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia rank the bottom three. The average values of other provinces are higher than 0.9, and the difference is small.

Awino; Martin Ogutu; Joseph Owino,"The study conceptualized a relationship between technological innovation and strategic leadership on competitive advantage. Technological innovation has been posited to influence performance competitive advantage however; this position has been largely tautological and hence required more empirical testing. Although implied, the role of strategic leadership in the relationship between technological innovation and competitive advantage has been largely lacking. The study, therefore, specifically sought to determine the moderating role of strategic leadership on the relationship between technological innovation and competitive advantage of large telecommunication enterprises (LTEs) in Kenya. Significant transformations have been evident in Kenya’s telecommunication industry for the last two decades, which has resulted in intense competition, and technological innovation has become the new face of competition among these firms. The target population comprised all 83 large telecommunication enterprises in Kenya and census was used. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed in data analysis. Strategic leadership was found to have a positive and significant influence on the relationship between technological innovation and competitive advantage. It is deduced from the findings that strategic leadership would affect the strength of the relationship between technological innovation and competitive advantage. This can be attributed to the importance of organizational leadership’s role as decision makers and key enablers of technological innovation among large telecommunication enterprises. The study presented notable implications on the policy framework, the strategic management practice, and theory implications in the telecommunication industry and beyond. At policy level, the Government of Kenya would benefit from the study by ensuring that policy makers and regulatory authorities in the telecommunication sector formulate policies that would promote technological innovation and strategic leadership for enhancing competitive advantage. Managerial practitioners may consider institutionalizing innovation and leadership by creating the requisite direction and controls that enable the emergence of innovation and value creation for sustainable competitive advantage.

Finite element simulations and uniaxial compression experiments are carried out to study the influence of the main parameters on the effective mechanical properties of the structures. The numerical results fit well with the experimental results. Compared with the three-dimensional star-shaped honeycomb (3D-SSH), the negative Poisson's ratio effect and effective Young’s modulus of the 3D-ESSH are significantly enhanced. Comparison among the proposed novel honeycombs indicate that the effective mechanical performance of the structure can be improved more obviously if the reinforcing rods are only added in the loading direction. In addition, the impact of reinforcing rods on the effective thermal expansion coefficient of the novel 3D-ESSH is investigated.

Unfortunately, since the development of parallel codes requires highly specific knowledge, it can become a challenge for beginners and non-expert programmers, especially when it comes to making adequate and efficient use of the available computing resources. To this end, we developed a transcompiler for helping researchers and inexperienced users who do not have the necessary skills in the use of parallel programming, and aimed at improving the performance of their HPC routines and tasks. Current efforts are focused on an additional module for optimizing code fragments in order to reduce their running times. In order to achieve this, twenty-six software techniques were selected from the literature to be integrated into this new module, all of them aimed at improving execution times of HPC programs by directly writing efficient code. Their effectiveness is analyzed and discussed in the current manuscript through a complete set of tests designed and conducted to measure and evaluate benefits achieved when applying these techniques.",Software engineering; Set (psychology); Code (cryptography); Order (business); Software; Measure (data warehouse); Code development; Computer science; Supercomputer,,0

In addition, this study also uses an interaction variable (TI*GLOB) to check the interaction role of technological innovation on the linkage between globalization and CO2 emission, besides their direct effect on CO2 emissions in OBOR countries. The outcomes revealed that the linkage between technological innovation and CO2 emissions is negative, and statically significant in all the regions (e.g., OBOR, South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, MENA, Europe, and Central Asia). Moreover, the results of globalization show a significant positive relationship with CO2 emissions in OBOR and South Asia region. Nevertheless, it significantly negatively affects environmental pollution in East and Southeast Asia, MENA, Europe, and Central Asia. The results of TI*GLOB indicate that, for the OBOR sample, East and Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, the moderation effects of technological innovation with globalization are significantly negatively associated with CO2 emissions. However, in MENA and Europe, the interaction effect is a significant positive. The coefficient of ICT for OBOR, Europe, and Central Asia are positive and statistically significant; however, for East, Southeast Asia, and MENA regions, these results are statistically negative. Furthermore, the findings are robust, according to various robustness checks that we have performed for checking the reliability of our main findings.

It is conceived within the SMARTGRID Project co-funded by the National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work, INAIL. Workers and obstacles are equipped with multiple passive UHF-RFID tags, whereas the reader-equipped machinery is able to determine its distance from tags according to an amplitude-based ranging method which exploits a two-rays electromagnetic channel model. Such signal model is here firstly presented and discussed. In particular, it is based on the received power ratio from a couple of tags to release from the knowledge of the tag backscattered gain thus avoiding calibration procedures typical of classical amplitude-based methods. After a numerical analysis to investigate the effect of several system parameters, the signal model is validated through a preliminary experimental campaign in the context of the SMARTGRID Project. Such a ranging system can increase the safety of workers when accompanied by an alarm system which signals any potential collision occurring in the working areas.",Smart grid; Ranging; Collision; Exploit; Work (electrical); ALARM; Context (language use); Collision avoidance; Computer science; Real-time computing,,3

At the same time, relevant management personnel of agricultural enterprises should pay attention to the issue of CSR input intensity in the process of fulfilling CSR, and should try to avoid getting into relationships with these stakeholders due to excessive reliance on CSR to meet the demands of relevant external stakeholders. In this way, it brings unnecessary costs to the technological innovation activities of enterprises, and ultimately leads to the reduction of innovation efficiency and performance. This article puts forward the research on the impact of agricultural corporate social responsibility on the continuous innovation of the enterprise itself. Agricultural enterprises are considering CSR as a means to promote corporate technological innovation and are investing in it. Relevant managers must first think about whether there are some inert factors in the company, including outdated organizational processes and organizational practices. Once such inert factors are discovered, in order to ensure that the company's investment in CSR can finally be effectively transformed into corporate technology Innovative performance, it is necessary for relevant managers to take some targeted actions in the specific practice process to overcome the negative effects of these inertia factors.",Agriculture; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Social responsibility; Order (exchange); Investment (macroeconomics); Organizational processes; Industrial organization; Process (engineering); Promotion (rank),,1

Bustinza,"Existing innovation frameworks suggest that manufacturing firms have traditionally developed a complementary model of technological innovations comprising process and product innovations (e.g. Oslo Manual). This article presents digital service innovation as a novel form of technological innovation that is capable of enhancing the performance of firms in certain manufacturing industries.,Drawing on technological innovation and digital servitization fields of research, this study argues that digital service innovation, in manufacturing contexts, complements traditional sources of technological innovation, so increasing the profit margins of firms. This effect is significant in industries characterized by business-to-business contexts, high presence of link channels and long product life spans (e.g. manufacturing and computer-based industries). Predictions are tested on a unique sample of 423 Spanish manufacturing firms using parametric (t-test) and nonparametric (fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, fsQCA) approaches.,The results of this analysis show that a necessary condition so that manufacturing firms can increase profits is the deployment of simultaneous process and product innovations. It also reveals that optimal configuration requires that digital service innovation be undertaken, particularly in machinery and computer-based manufacturing industries. Hence, all three sources of technological innovation are brought together in order to reach the highest levels of company performance. The evidence suggests that technological innovation and digital servitization are closely interrelated in highly innovative manufacturing contexts.,This study's originality and value reside in the fact that it reveals the existence of firms incorporating digital service innovation – a new, technological innovation dimension that challenges existing innovation frameworks – to complement traditional technological innovation sources, namely process and product innovation. Moreover, the study conceptualizes and empirically tests the value-adding role of digital services in firms' technological innovation portfolio.",Business; Manufacturing; Profit margin; Portfolio; Service innovation; Industrial organization; Paradigm shift; Product (business); Product innovation; Qualitative comparative analysis,,8

It reveals that engaging in export trade increases corporate innovation input and output. In terms of patent output, export trade greatly promotes the output of invention patents and utility model patents with a high technological content. These conclusions remain valid after a series of robustness and endogeneity tests. Regarding the mechanisms of the observed relationships, export trade stimulates corporate technological innovation mainly by realizing economies of scale and increasing risk-taking. The positive correlation between export trade and corporate technological innovation is strongest among state-owned enterprises, non-high-tech enterprises, enterprises based in central and eastern China, enterprises engaged in general trade, and enterprises exporting to developed economies. Given the growing trade frictions ongoing at the time of writing, the conclusions of this study provide vital practical guidance and empirical evidence for a national strategy of innovation-driven development.",Business; Empirical evidence; Robustness (economics); Utility model; Economies of scale; Export trade; Corporate innovation; Difference in differences; Industrial organization; Endogeneity,,0

To explore the low-carbon effects of technological innovation, based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2009 to 2017, this paper established a spatial panel measurement model and a panel threshold regression model to explore the spatial spillover effects and threshold characteristics of technological innovation on industrial carbon productivity. The research shows the following: on the one hand, technological innovation and industrial carbon productivity each has obvious spatial correlation, and technological innovation has a significant spatial spillover effect on the improvement of industrial carbon productivity, and the indirect spillover between regions is greater than the direct spillover effect within the area. On the other hand, the impact of technological innovation on industrial carbon productivity has a double threshold effect. With the continuous improvement of technological innovation capabilities, the promotion of industrial carbon productivity has become increasingly more influential. Through the division of threshold values, the technological innovation capabilities of various regions in China are significantly heterogeneous, and the overall level is low. Although technological innovation capabilities have improved in recent years, there is still much room for improvement. Finally, this article puts forward relevant suggestions from the construction of regional technological innovation system, economical green circular development, and the establishment of a green technological innovation system.",Global warming; Economics; China; Threshold model; Productivity; Technological innovation system; Industrial organization; Spillover effect; Panel data; Promotion (rank),Industrial carbon productivity; Spatial spillover effects; Technological innovation; Threshold model,8

Moreover, the mediating model is employed to examine the mediating effect of green technological innovation in the industrial co-agglomeration affects TFEE. Last but not least, the threshold panel regression model is conducted to verify the nonlinear relationship between industrial co-agglomeration and TFEE. The results show that there is a U-shaped curve relationship between industrial co-agglomeration and TFEE. Moreover, there are obvious regional heterogeneities in the impact of industrial co-agglomeration on TFEE and its spatial spillover effect. Meanwhile, industrial co-agglomeration has a significant indirect impact on TFEE through green technological innovation.

This paper not only discusses the intermediary effect of agency problems on environmental uncertainty and corporate technological innovation but also deeply explores the influence of information transparency, government subsidies, and other mechanisms to alleviate agency problems on environmental uncertainty and corporate technological innovation. We use the data of listed companies in China from 2008 to 2019 as the research sample, and the results show that, in general, environmental uncertainty has a negative effect on both input and output of technological innovation, and the negative effect can last for two years. Further research shows that the agency problem has an intermediary effect on the environmental uncertainty and corporate technology innovation, and the environmental uncertainty aggravates the agency problem, which hinders the input and output of corporate technology innovation. As an important mechanism to alleviate the agency problems, information transparency and government subsidies can effectively alleviate the agency conflict, thus reducing the inhibition of environmental uncertainty on the input and output of technological innovation.

The effects of nanoparticle content and high temperature on various electrical (DC, AC, and high frequency) and thermal properties of EP are investigated. It is found that the nano h-BN addition enhances thermal performance and weakens electrical insulation properties. On the other side, under HF and HT stress, the presence of h-BN nanoparticles significantly improves the electrical performance of BN/EP nanocomposites. The EP has superior insulation properties at low temperature and low frequency, whereas the BN/EP nanocomposites exhibit better insulation performance than EP under HF and HT. The factors such as homogeneous nanoparticle dispersion in EP, enhanced thermal conductivity, nanoparticle surface modification, weight percent of nanoparticles, the mismatch between the relative permittivity of EP and nano h-BN, and the presence of voids in nanocomposites play the crucial role.

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.With the continuous development of marine technology, the tasks of marine survey, exploration, navigation, transportation and development are becoming more and more serious. It is necessary to pay attention to the problem of planning resource allocation in coastal areas, so as to design a more reasonable resource allocation scheme. The traditional analysis model can only converge locally, resulting in the deviation of the analysis results of resource allocation efficiency. Therefore, the construction method of the efficiency analysis model of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises based on genetic algorithm is proposed. According to the relationship between fuzzy operator and fuzzy scale, this method calculates the carrying capacity of coastal environmental resources. In light of the prediction results of the dynamic demand forecast function of emergency resources, it sets the evaluation weight of the efficiency of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises. Based on the global convergence characteristics of genetic algorithm, it realizes the construction of the efficiency analysis model of technological innovation resource allocation of coastal enterprises. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional method, the model based on genetic algorithm has stronger convergence and can achieve global data convergence. It can be seen that the analysis results of this model accord with the reality and can be applied to the analysis of resource allocation efficiency at this stage.",Carrying capacity; Environmental economics; Port (computer networking); Marine technology; Resource allocation; Computer science; Dynamic demand; Fuzzy logic; Function (engineering); Genetic algorithm,,4

In addition, very limited researches consider the role of technological innovation in ecological sustainability even though technological innovation is indispensable to achieve technological advancement, which may help in sustainable development and ecological sustainability. Therefore, this work probes the effects of technological innovation, financial development, and economic growth (GDP) on the ecological footprint (EF) controlling urbanization and employing a STIRPAT framework. The analysis of data from West Asia and Middle East nations from 1990 to 2017 revealed cointegration in the model. The long-run coefficients produced by the continuously updated fully modified technique revealed that a 1% upsurge in technological innovation decreases EF by 0.010%. Interestingly, technological innovation is helpful to decrease EF and enhance economic growth in the West Asia and Middle East (WAME) countries. However, a 1% rise in FD boosts the level of EF by 0.0016% inferring that FD stimulates ecological degradation. Likewise, urbanization in the WAME countries raises EF levels and contributes adversely to ecological quality. In addition to this, the study revealed the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in the selected countries accounting for technological innovation, FD, and urbanization in the model. The causal analysis provided evidence of unidirectional causality from FD to EF and bidirectional causality between technological innovation and EF. The study recommends more investment in research and development and strong collaboration between the universities and industries to promote the level of technological innovation for both sustainable development and ecological sustainability.

The major changes witnessed in the sector have been immense advances in financial technological innovations which are as a result of uproars in the global financial environment. With the rapid and extensive increase in technological innovations, new distribution channels in the financial sector are coming up speedily. These include Automated Teller Machines, Mobile Banking and Internet Banking. These have made accessibility of money easy to bank customers since they can get it at their convenience. The evenly spread of Automated Teller Machines in most parts of the country has further made it easier for bank customers to withdraw and deposit money and/ or cheques at their convenience. These facts notwithstanding, it has been observed that most Kenyans bank customers have not fully embraced the technological innovations. This has been largely caused by bank customers’ negative perceptions towards technological innovations. As a result, most bank customers have clung to the old traditions which make them resistant and non-adaptable to technological innovations. These have been witnessed in the behaviors of most bank customers whereby they are still queuing in the banking halls despite the availability of Mobile Banking, Automated Teller Machines, and Internet Banking. The general objective of the study was an assessment of customers’ adaptability to the technological innovations in Kenya’s banking industry with the effects of customers’ perceptions. A specific objective was derived from the main objective. Two questionnaires were designed which were used to collect the views of the respondents. The population of the study comprised of senior managers from ten Commercial banks and bank customers employed in different organizations and those who were self-employed. The banking customers were selected at random. A cross-sectional ex-post facto research design was applied. Findings revealed a significant relationship between technological innovations and customers’ adaptability in Kenya’s banking sector. The significant moderating effect of customers’ perceptions on the relationship between technological innovations and customers’ adaptability in Kenya’s banking sector. The study suggested that bank management should intensify their campaign on awareness stressing the benefits that accrue from the use of financial technological innovations; tighten their securities especially in ATMs and Internet Banking and charge minimum amounts for the services. Prior studies hitherto concentrated on the benefits of technological innovations to the banking sectors and their employees; the extent by which technological innovations improved the financial performance of the banking sector and developed Kenya’s technological industry. The studies greatest contribution to knowledge is that to attain maximum technological innovations, bank customers’ negative perceptions and resistance to change should undergo a complete overhaul.

Therefore, this paper studies the impact of technological innovation on the total employment of China from an empirical perspective. Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and TFP growth rate calculated by the Solow residual method are used as indicators of the level of technological innovation, and the long-term cointegration regression model and short-term impulse response function are established with the number of employees and employment growth rate as the dependent variables, respectively. The study found that, the impact of technological innovation on employment levels has a stable promotion effect in the long run; in the short run, there is a destructive effect at first, but as time goes by, this destructive mechanism gradually occupies the peak, and the creative mechanism begins to take effect. The leading role, technological innovation has a steady promotion effect on employment.",Total factor productivity; Cointegration; Labour economics; Regression analysis; Solow residual; Economics; China; Short run; Variables; Employment growth,,1

Qamruzzaman,"<jats:p>The present study investigates the nexus between urbanization, technological innovation, renewable energy consumption, and environmental quality in Egypt and Ethiopia from 1980 to 2020 by employing symmetric and asymmetric frameworks. Referring to symmetric assessment, the coefficient of renewable energy consumption and technological innovation revealed a negative and statistically significant tie with environmental sustainability, valid for both proxies. Study findings suggest that clean energy integration and technological innovations in the economy decrease environmental adversity by reducing carbon emissions and ecological blames. Although the elasticity of urbanization has documented a positive and statistically significant connection with environmental sustainability, the conclusion is valid for both models. Second, in the long run, the asymmetric shocks of renewable energy consumption and technological innovation have exposed a negative and statistically significant tie to environmental sustainability, whereas in the case of urbanization, the asymmetric shocks unveiled a positive and statistically significant association to environmental sustainability. Third, the study revealed that the feedback hypothesis explains the relationship between technological innovation and environmental sustainability [TI←→EF] in Egypt and ecological footprint and urbanization in Egypt and Ethiopia. Moreover, unidirectional causality runs from ecological footprint to renewable energy consumption in Egypt and Ethiopia.</jats:p>",Sustainability; Nexus (standard); Urbanization; Renewable energy; Ecological footprint; Natural resource economics; Energy consumption; Economics; Environmental quality; Consumption (sociology); Emergy; Environmental degradation,,1

However, the limited absorption and serious backscattering of hot-electrons result in inadequate quantum yields, especially in the mid-infrared range. Here, we report a macroscopic assembled graphene (nMAG) nanofilm/silicon heterojunction for ultrafast mid-infrared photodetection. The assembled Schottky diode works in 1.5–4.0 μm at room temperature with fast response (20–30 ns, rising time, 4 mm2 window) and high detectivity (1.6 × 1011 to 1.9 × 109 Jones from 1.5 to 4.0 μm) under the pulsed laser, outperforming single-layer-graphene/silicon photodetectors by 2–8 orders. These performances are attributed to the greatly enhanced photo-thermionic effect of electrons in nMAG due to its high light absorption (~40%), long carrier relaxation time (~20 ps), low work function (4.52 eV), and suppressed carrier number fluctuation. The nMAG provides a long-range platform to understand the hot-carrier dynamics in bulk 2D materials, leading to broadband and ultrafast MIR active imaging devices at room temperature.",Materials science; Graphene; Optoelectronics; Photodetection; Photodetector; Infrared; Ultrashort pulse; Silicon; Thermionic emission; Absorption (acoustics); Electron,,3

Survey data on the commercialization of patents are related to patent value indicators (patent renewal, patent family size and forward citations) from archival sources. Among the patent value indicators, both the length of patent renewal and the size of the patent family indicate that a patent has been commercialized. Patent renewal for at least 6 years is sufficient to predict an accurate probability of commercialization. Furthermore, patent renewal is the only indicator revealing whether commercialization is successful. Forward citations have a moderate relationship with both commercialization and successful innovation, which may reflect the fact that citations are outside the control of the patentees or that forward citations measure spillovers rather than the private value. Although the correlations of the patent value indicators with technological innovation are noisy, this study provides stronger empirical support for the true relative value of different indicators with respect to innovation.",Empirical research; Business; Empirical evidence; Survey data collection; Relative value; Value (economics); Commercialization; Industrial organization,,1

This chapter explores contentions that life is getting faster and in so doing leads to experiences of time pressure. The idea that societies are accelerating as a consequence of technological innovations has been popular throughout the modern period. Acceleration in the nineteenth century was associated with technological advances in transport and communications, the rapid circulation of goods and the emergence of fashion as a means of expressing lifestyle and identity. Further technological innovations in travel and communications in the post-Second World War period further accelerate the pace of modern life to the extent that some theorists claim that the only stable feature of late-modern societies is their constant and rapid change. The rate of technological innovations constantly increases, the speed of change outstrips the pace at which social institutions (e.g. the family, occupational structures and forms of governance) can respond, and together mean that everyday lives come to be an overwhelming experience of speed and time pressure. Digital technologies bring with them new expectations of ‘instantaneous’ access to knowledge, goods and services, and in the process fragment and intensify activities. They also offer scope for new ‘temporalities’ based around ‘network time’. Empirical studies, however, provide limited corroboration of activity fragmentation or intensification, and research into interactions with email, mobile phones and the internet suggest that such technologies afford forms of deceleration and control juxtaposed with experiences of acceleration and feelings of being overwhelmed by competing demands on one’s time.",The Internet; Empirical research; Business; Goods and services; Temporalities; Pace; Identity (social science); Everyday life; Market economy; Corporate governance,,1

Based on these highlights, this study examines sustainable development for the panel of selected Sub-Sahara African countries that are largely plagued with huge energy deficit (energy poverty) and setback in technological innovation. This study leverages on panel econometrics strategies to explore the hypothesized relationship between the outlined indicators for the period 2000–2016 in Sub-Saharan African countries. Empirical results show that human development index (HDI), economic expansion, access to clean energy. and technological innovation exhibits long-run equilibrium relationship. Subsequently, the finding revealed that economic expansion, access to energy and technological innovation in the sampled countries spur higher HDI indices. That is, a 1% increase in economic growth increases HDI by 0.040% and 0.017% in the short and long run respectively. Thus, we can infer that enhanced sustainable economic growth leads to higher HDI indices which encompases higher literacy rate, better income level and increase life expectancy in both short and long run. In contrary, access to clean energy in the selected blocs dampens HDI index in the short run but the effect is statistically positive (desirable) in the long run.",Economics; Short run; Prosperity; Energy poverty; Human Development Index; Energy consumption; Human development (humanity); Development economics; Economic expansion; Sustainable development,,0

Smart PSS can overcome this obstacle and guarantee correct and safe PSS use. In this context, intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) with PSS can effectively reduce traffic accidents and ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians by guaranteeing optimal and safe vehicle operation. A core subsystem to support that is the collision-warning system (CWS). Existing CWSs are, however, limited to in-car warning; users have less access to the warning information, so the result of CWS for collision avoidance is insufficient. Therefore, CWS needs to be extended to include more elements and stakeholders in the collision scenario. This paper aims to provide a novel understanding of extended CWS (ECWS), outline the conceptual framework of ECWS, and contribute a conceptual modeling approach of ECWS from the smart PSS perspective at the functional level. It defines an integrated solution of intelligent products and warning services. The function is modeled based on the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). Functions of an ECWS from the perspective of smart PSS can be comprehensively expressed to form an overall solution of integrated intelligent products, electronic services, and stakeholders.

In the existing literature, there is no significant empirical evidence on the dynamic relationship among technological innovation, air transport freight, FDI, and economic growth in BRICS-MT countries. Thus, the current study contributes to the growing literature regarding the role of technological Innovation, air transport, and FDI on economic growth. To this end, we explore the dynamic nexus between technological innovation, air transport, FDI, and economic growth in 7 selected emerging BRICS-MT countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Mexico, and Turkey. This study covers the most recent updated period for panel data from 2000 to 2019. We applied panel cointegration, dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), and Granger causality tests to draw empirical inferences. The Pedroni panel and Kao residual cointegration tests confirm the long-run relationships among the variables. The DOLS results indicate that air transport freight, technological innovation, and FDI significantly positively impact economic growth. This study's findings confirmed the endogenous growth model in BRICS-MT countries. Furthermore, the Granger causality test results show the feedback effect of FDI on economic growth. The outcomes of this study also show the unidirectional causal relationship between air transport freight and economic growth. Moreover, the results provide support to economic policymakers in their decision-making.

This significant growth is pushing mobile network operators towards new solutions to improve their network performance and efficiency. Thus, the appearance of Software Defined Networking (SDN) can overcome the limitations of current deployments through decoupling the network control plane from the data plane, allowing higher flexibility and programmability to the network. In this context, the process of handling user mobility becomes an essential part of future mobile networks. Taking advantage of the benefits that SDN brings, in this article we present a novel mobility management solution. This proposal avoids the use of IP-IP tunnels and it adds the dynamic flow management capability provided by SDN. In order to analyse performance, an analytical model is developed to compare it with NB-DMM (Network-based DMM), one of the main DMM (Distributed Mobility Management) solutions. Additionally, performance is also evaluated with an experimental testbed. The results allow handover latency in real scenarios and numerical investigations to be measured, and also show that SR-DMM achieves better efficiency in terms of signaling and routing cost than NB-DMM solution.</jats:p>",Computer architecture; Network architecture; 5G; Software; Mobility management; Computer science,,0

To achieve the study objective, we explored the role of technological innovation, FDI, trade openness, energy use and economic growth toward carbon emissions. Using the data of 1985-2017, the study employed ARDL bound testing and VECM methods to capture the effects of technological innovation, trade openness, FDI, energy use and economic growth on CO2 emissions. Empirical estimation has confirmed the existence of long-run cointegration. Similarly, in the long-run, it is found that trade openness, energy use and economic growth positively reinforce CO2 emissions. In contrast, technological innovation and FDI negatively reinforce CO2 emissions in the long-run. Further, VECM indicate that the relationship among innovation, trade openness, and energy use is bidirectional in the long-run. Whereas, unidirectional relation has been found that is coming from GDP to carbon emissions, FDI, innovation, trade, and energy use.

This paper investigates the green development of 32 countries along the Belt and Road during the period of 2010–2018, and uses the Data Envelopment Analysis method to measure the green development level of countries along the Belt and Road. Based on the dynamic panel model, the system generalized method of moments is used to estimate the impact of foreign trade and technological innovation on green development. The results indicate that most of countries along the Belt and Road are in inefficient green development, and that there is still much room for improvement. Meanwhile, foreign trade and technological innovation can significantly contribute to green development of countries along the Belt and Road. Further research has found that there is a threshold effect on the impact of technological innovation on green development of countries along the Belt and Road. Therefore, it is suggested that policymakers should promote green development of countries along the Belt and Road by strengthening their trade flows, improving innovation efficiency, changing the way of urbanization and optimizing their health care systems.",International trade; Economics; Generalized method of moments; Data envelopment analysis; Green development; Threshold effect; Urbanization,,0

Based on the panel data of Chinese renewable energy enterprises from 2010 to 2019, this paper uses fixed effect and sys-GMM model to investigate the moderating effect of resource endowment between environmental regulation and technological innovation efficiency. The results show that the economical and supervised environment regulation are positively correlated with technological innovation efficiency, while the legal environmental regulation is the opposite. Moreover, resource endowment is positively related to technological innovation efficiency, especially for non-state-owned renewable energy enterprises, which reflects the existence of a certain degree of “resource curse” in state-owned renewable energy enterprises. In addition, resource endowment has a significant negative moderating effect in the relationship between environmental regulation and technological innovation efficiency, which shows that with the increase of resource endowment, the impact of economical and supervised environmental regulation on technological innovation efficiency will weaken, while the impact of legal environmental regulation on technological innovation efficiency will strengthen. It is helpful for the government to formulate more accurate resource and environmental regulation policies to improve the technological innovation efficiency.",Endowment; Microdata (statistics); Porter hypothesis; Resource (disambiguation); Panel data; Industrial organization; Economics; Renewable energy; Environmental economics; Technological change; Natural resource economics; Business; Environmental regulation,,1

Here, we attempted to express and assemble GV proteins (GVPs) into GVs using the model eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We first selected and expressed two core structural proteins, GvpA and GvpC from cyanobacteria Anabaena flos-aquae and Planktothrix rubescens, respectively. We then optimized the protein production conditions and validated GV assembly in the context of GV shapes. We found that when two copies of AnaA were integrated into the genome, the chromosomal expression of AnaA resulted in GV production regardless of GvpC expression. Next, we co-expressed chaperone-RFP with the GFP-AnaA to aid the AnaA aggregation. The co-expression of individual chaperones (Hsp42, Sis1, Hsp104, and GvpN) with AnaA led to the formation of larger inclusions and enhanced the sequestration of AnaA into the perivacuolar site. To our knowledge, this represents the first study on reconstitution of GVs in S. cerevisiae. Our results could provide insights into optimizing conditions for heterologous protein production as well as the reconstitution of other synthetic microcompartments in yeast.

Latecomers from emerging economies compress time and skip amplitude by breaking the original strategic path and form a new appropriate strategic path to catch up with the incumbents. Previous studies have found that the original strategic path is difficult to break and difficult to transform. This paper proposes a firm-level framework and identifies the impetus and trigger factors for latecomers to transform the strategic path. The impetus is the mismatch between strategic mode and technological innovation capability. The trigger is the progressive industrial policy. Based on a Chinese rail transit equipment supplier’s (China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation; CRRC) catch-up process, this paper finds that the strategic path transformation is an evolutionary process from mismatch to rematch between strategic mode and technological innovation capability. With the implementation of industrial policy, the technological innovation capability will change. The original strategic mode does not match with changed technological innovation capability, which leads to performance pressure. With the adjustment of industrial policy, a new strategic mode adapted to new technological innovation capability emerges. This paper clarifies the source that determines successful catch-up practices for latecomers and contributes to latecomers’ sustainable growth in emerging economies.",Emerging markets; Mode (statistics); Sustainable growth rate; Business; Corporation; Industrial organization; Process (engineering); Exploratory research; Industrial policy; Path (graph theory),,4

State-of-the-art approaches first select the most relevant dates from the original event timeline then produce per-date news summaries. Date selection is driven by either per-date news content or date-level references. When coping with complex event data, characterized by inherent news flow redundancy, this pipeline may encounter relevant issues in both date selection and summarization due to a limited use of news content in date selection and no use of high-level temporal references (e.g., the past month). This paper proposes a paradigm shift in timeline summarization aimed at overcoming the above issues. It presents a new approach, namely Summarize Date First, which focuses on first generating date-level summaries then selecting the most relevant dates on top of summarized knowledge. In the latter stage, it performs date aggregations to consider high-level temporal references as well. The proposed pipeline also supports frequent incremental timeline updates more efficiently than previous approaches. We tested our unsupervised approach both on existing benchmark datasets and on a newly proposed benchmark dataset describing the COVID-19 news timeline.

The implementation of the green credit policy restricts loans to industries with high energy consumption, high pollution, and overcapacity to prevent excessive expansion and consumption of resources, thereby achieving the goals of industrial restructuring and environmental protection. Technological innovation is an important means to cope with environmental changes and adjust the industrial structure. Can technological innovation under green credit achieve the upgrading of the industrial structure? This paper combines green credit, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading to conduct research, and theoretically analyzes the impact of green credit and technological innovation on industrial structure upgrading, and analyzes how green credit affects industrial structure upgrading through technological innovation. An empirical test using panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2017 revealed that green credit can promote the upgrading of the industrial structure. Econometric analysis based on the mediation effect model found that green credit not only directly promotes the upgrading of the industrial structure, but also has the mediation effect that affects the upgrading of the industrial structure through technological innovation. In the sub-regional regression analysis, technological innovation affects the upgrading of the industrial structure. The mediation effect is still significant. Based on the research in this article, it is recommended to actively implement green credit policies, expand the scale of green credit, firmly implement the innovation-driven development strategy, and at the same time vigorously develop clean energy and reduce energy consumption. The research significance of the article is to explore the impact of green credit on industrial structure upgrading, which has implications for the implementation and promotion of subsequent green credit policies.

To exclude the field-dependent distortion on a barrier for a direct unbiased evaluation in JBS structures, this work proposes a new evaluation method with a physics-based derivation and experimental demonstration, where a batch of JBS diodes are fabricated with a quasi-continuous spacing variation distribution achieved by the spreading etching technique. In addition, a detailed analysis based on the field-dependent barrier is provided. The result illustrates the chain-like activation and its saturation limit with a quantitative estimate in the straggle region. With the capability of the high linearity to exploit the statistical information for analysis stability, the proposed indicator could be a quantitative and versatile reference for designers dealing with nonideal surfaces. </jats:p>",Schottky barrier; Materials science; Silicon carbide; Schottky diode; Saturation current; Optoelectronics; Diode; Linearity; Silicon; Etching (microfabrication); Electronic engineering,,0

Patent citation analysis was used to capture the trend of technological innovation associated with libraries.,The findings are as follows: (1) library technologies are now in the ascent phase of their life cycles; (2) private companies from the United States, Germany, France, Japan and the United Kingdom are the top-five owners of intellectual property rights associated with library technology and (3) patent data along with knowledge and technology indicators can be interpreted in the light of library development. The knowledge source with the highest degree of scientific and technological orientation was identified as basic material chemistry. The major technological categories that have received the greatest knowledge effect from library-associated technological innovation are chemistry, electrical engineering, instruments, mechanical engineering, with other fields (civil engineering and furniture, games) being subject to less effect.,There are two research limitations in this study. First, the results use single informants, patents retrieved from United States Patent and Trademark Office, as the source of data. Second, this study uses patent citation measures for exploring the knowledge source and effect of technological innovation, these measures are only subjective for those new invention highly based technological advances. This study concludes that technological innovation for libraries will be characterized by an increasing role for science-intensive and interdisciplinary areas. This study also suggests that organizational learning facilitates innovation. Therefore, a library hoping to co-evolve with dynamic environment through technological innovation should improve its organizational learning processes.,Theories of technology-push and demand-pull were examined in relation to technological innovation taking place in libraries. The TLC analysis indicated that library technology is mainly in the ascent stage, suggesting that libraries have not achieved the strongest technological transformation. The findings suggest that the importance of demand-pull and technology-push vary over the TLC of libraries.,To survive in a dynamic environment library must be able to cope with increasing complexity and high-speed technological change. It is pivotal to integrate the views of users (as customers), software houses or design companies (as suppliers) as well as other libraries (as communities) into the sustainable development strategy of a library. In these contexts, libraries with the capacity to innovate will be able to respond to new demands faster and to invent and provide new services better than noninnovative libraries.,Analysis based on the technological innovation perspective to identify the future development of libraries is still lacking. This paper seeks to identify the technological innovation employed in libraries to accommodate the 21st century model of information-seeking behavior. This study identifies a variety of factors that have influenced the transformation of library services, and these include technology developments and new demands from library users. To illustrate the driving forces of technology-push in libraries, this paper examines holistic-patented technologies invented for libraries.",Variety (cybernetics); Technological change; Business; Organizational learning; Relation (database); Technology life cycle; Trademark; Intellectual property; Sustainable development; Knowledge management,,4

Here, we investigate these phenomena through technological outputs of over 4,000 regions spanning 42 countries, by analyzing more than 30 years of patent data (approximately 2.7 million patents) from the European Patent Office. We construct a bipartite network --- based on revealed comparative advantage --- linking geographic regions with areas of technology and compare its properties to those of artificial networks using a series of randomization strategies, to uncover the patterns of regional diversity and technological ubiquity. Our results show that the technological outputs of regions create nested patterns similar to those of ecological networks. These patterns suggest that regions need to dominate various technologies first (those allegedly less sophisticated), creating a diverse knowledge base, before subsequently developing less ubiquitous (and perhaps more sophisticated) technologies as a consequence of complementary knowledge that facilitates innovation. Finally, we create a map --- the Patent Space Network --- showing the interactions between technologies according to their regional presence.

Kondratieff's long wave cycle hypothesis was the first theory that described the long-term economic fluctuations. Schumpeter analyzed and illustrated the formation of long wave from multiple aspects in the economic cycle theory, believing that the technological innovation was the root cause, the four-stage model represented the track of movement, the nested pattern of three cycles indicated internal circulation, and the external change was the one of causes for economic cycle. In light of the Schumpeter economic cycle theory and the new Schumpeterian theory, the causes of five economic long waves in history are analyzed from the perspective of technological innovation. The results show that the causes of the rise and fall in all the long waves are very similar: long wave boom is driven by major technological innovation, and long wave recession is caused by failure of technology innovation, and the turning point of every long wave cycle from prosperity to recession is triggered by the burst of the stock market bubble. Therefore, as the new round of industrial revolution is in the ascendant and the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the world economy, China must improve its ability of technological innovation so as to take the lead in the future development.",Stock market bubble; Boom; Economics; Keynesian economics; Kondratiev wave; Recession; Prosperity; World economy; Industrial Revolution; Business cycle,,0

Technological change is an evolutionary process. Research and technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that is irreversible in the sense that inventions can be superseded but not ""uninvented"". Technological innovation creates knowledge and technology that is cumulative because it lays a platform for further knowledge creation, or sets in place another rung in an ascending ladder of new performance characteristics or properties which are demonstrably superior to their antecedents. In turn, the asset specificity and irreversibility of technology and its cumulativeness create barriers to competitive entry. This allows a firm to earn the premiums that create market power and allow further innovation to be financed. The model of technological innovation advanced in this thesis has at its core the strategic governance framework of a firm, within which the dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are catalysed and made productive by differentiated technological learning processes. No one type of technological learning applies universally, but rather learning is differentiated by variables such as firm size and structure, the past experience and core competencies of the firm, its human capital stocks, social processes, interactions with the external environment, and a host of market, institutional and technological factors. It is argued that the dynamics of significant new technology, human capital and social processes are fundamental and necessary conditions of technological innovation. Technological learning processes underly and provide a connecting thread that integrates these necessary conditions into a model of technological innovation that can be applied by managers to create and sustain competitive advantage. Technological learning both shapes and is shaped by the human capital stocks and social processes of a firm. Learning processes give rise to significant new technology, and the dynamics of that technology in turn helps catalyse and gives rise to further learning. The rate and direction of learning and of technological innovation is also driven by the firm's interaction with external sources of ideas and technology. To create competitive advantage through technological innovation business managers must address a firm's strategy, human capital-related assets, social processes and technological learning abilities. Policy managers must ensure that the public technostructure is in place to foster human capital creation within an economy and to facilitate access to new ideas and sources of stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",Technological change; Industrial organization; Human capital; Business; Competitive advantage; Knowledge management,,0

Distributed generations (DGs) are connected in series to form a DG string, and many DG strings supply power in parallel. However, the conventional droop control is not suitable for HSPM due to its complex structure. Existing control methods rely on central controllers or complex communication networks, to the detriment of reliability and flexibility. In this paper, the power transmission characteristics are analyzed and a low communication dependency control strategy is proposed for autonomous HSPM to achieve power sharing. Only one DG is selected as a leader in each string, and adjacent leaders exchange information with each other to match active power differences. The rest of DGs follow the leaders by a unified droop control without communication. This method has a simple control structure and only a few communication links among leaders are deployed, which greatly improves reliability, flexibility and reduces communication costs. Finally, the feasibility and satisfactory performance of the proposed control strategy are verified.",Voltage droop; Microgrid; Reliability (semiconductor); Flexibility (engineering); Dependency (UML); String (physics); Computer science; Transmission (telecommunications); Power (physics); Control (management); Telecommunications network; Power control; Control engineering; Engineering; Control theory (sociology); Distributed computing,,0

Developing countries can take advantage of the late-mover advantage of the technological gap with developed countries to technologically catch-up at a faster speed and a lower cost by imitative innovation. According to the measurement of the innovation capability of the ""BRICS"" countries, China's technological diffusion capacity is lower than that of India, though it ranks first in technological innovation efficiency and technological input and output. From the perspective of economics, China's technological innovation path and its experience is to build the innovation advantage of a large country based on the market scale, exploit the imitation innovation advantage to technologically catch-up, and cultivate the independent innovation advantage through economic transformation.",Exploit; Imitation; Industrial organization; Technological change; Innovation economics; Comparative advantage; China; First-mover advantage; Competitive advantage; Business; Developing country; Economics; Economic system,,0

We are in the midst of an ecological crisis that will have profound consequences for human society and its natural environment. While the conditions for life have changed abruptly in the past, the current situation is characterized by the increasing power of a single species. Human beings are not only to blame for the unsustainable practices that brought us here, but also capable of harnessing their combined ingenuity to develop technology that may reduce environmental impacts and provide additional benefits for society. At the same time, the answer to the ecological crisis and other grand challenges is not found in the blind expansion of new technologies. Our success in accomplishing social and environmental objectives rather depends on how, where and when innovation influences patterns of production and consumption. This calls into question the focus of academics and policymakers on stimulating technological innovation. And it highlights the need for analytical tools that can be used to explore how policymakers and other actors may shape the direction of change. The research presented in this thesis therefore aims to develop a conceptual foundation for analyzing and shaping technological innovation. This effort draws on three qualitative case studies that investigate emerging renewable energy technologies from a Swedish perspective. The thesis is situated in the sustainability transitions research community and takes the literature on technological innovation systems as a theoretical point of departure. However, the research adopts a critical perspective and gradually departs from the core concepts used in this literature, over the course of a learning process that unfolds in five appended research papers. In the end, the thesis proposes the technological systems framework as a set of concepts that offers a multidimensional perspective on the dynamics and outcomes of technological innovation. It also presents empirical findings that demonstrate different development trajectories, reveal some of their underlying dynamics and highlight policy implications. This  will hopefully contribute to an ongoing shift in academia and politics – from stimulating the expansion of new technologies, to shaping the direction of change.",Sociotechnical system; Situated; Political science; Emerging technologies; Grand Challenges; Ecological crisis; Ingenuity; Consumption (sociology); Sustainability; Economic system,,1

The research shows that industrial investment fund involvement can increase the company's R&D investment by providing financial funds for the company, which can effectively solve the company's lack of funds in the process of technological innovation and guarantee the smooth running of the company's innovation activities. Secondly, government R&D subsidies can alleviate the pressure of R&D investment to a certain extent, which is conducive to promote a higher level of technological innovation in the company. Thirdly, for companies with industrial investment fund involvement, government R&D subsidies are conducive to promote technological innovation. In contrast, for companies without industrial investment fund involvement, government R&D subsidies have no significant impact on technological innovation to a certain extent or even have a ""crowding out effect.""",Subsidy; Investment (military); Government (linguistics); Business; Fund of funds; Finance; Crowding out; Investment fund; Economics; Industrial organization,R&D investment; government subsidies; industrial policy; sustainability; technological innovation,0

However, China’s NEV enterprises still have problems such as insufficient research of technology and unreasonable innovative resource allocation. To improve the technological innovation efficiency of China’s NEV enterprises, the NEVs’ technological innovation process is divided into two stages: the research and development (R&D) stage and the achievement transformation stage in this research. Combining Tobit regression with data envelopment analysis (DEA), an evaluation framework of technological innovation efficiency of the NEV enterprises is constructed. Then, the innovation efficiency of 23 NEV listed enterprises from 2013 to 2018 is analyzed. The result reveals three findings. First, the overall technological innovation efficiency of NEV enterprises is low. Second, enterprises’ R&D efficiency is generally higher than the achievement transformation efficiency. Third, according to two-stage efficiency, 23 NEV enterprises are divided into four categories. For different types of enterprises, targeted guidance to improve innovation efficiency is proposed.

The aim was to focus on the CSF non-neoplastic population, to compare the cellular composition of the CSF with paired peripheral blood samples and to document the feasibility of flow cytometry in hypocellular samples. Despite the extremely low cell count (1 cell/µl, range 1.0-35) the study was successfully conducted in 95% of the samples. T lymphocytes were the most abundant subset in CSF (77%; range 20-100%) with a predominance of CD4-positive over CD8-positive T cells (CD4/CD8 ratio = 2) together with a minority of monocytes (15%; range 0-70%). No B cells were identified in 90% of samples. Of relevance, a normal, non-clonal B-cell population was documented in 5/7 (71%) patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma at diagnosis (p<0.0001), suggesting a possible involvement of blood-brain barrier cell permeability in the pathogenesis of cerebral B-cell lymphomas.

Rossignol; Sebastien Roy; Rejean Fontaine,"Retinal implants aim to partially restore vision to patients suffering from blindness caused by age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Up until now, most prostheses were powered using an inductive link coupled with cables penetrating through the eyeball. Although they efficiently power the implant, they limit long-term reliability and cause postoperative complications. A fully wireless near-infrared power and data link entering the eye through the pupil alleviates these issues but limits the available power and causes energy supply interruptions during blinking. This article presents a retinal implant ASIC architecture optimized for optical operation despite these constraints. It contains 288 individually controlled electrode drivers, each connected to electrode pads with a pitch of 150 $\mu \text{m}$ . A digital controller with a stateless communication scheme allows flexible stimulation sequences and is capable of restoring stimulation within 3 ms after an eye blink.

This study employed a comprehensive environment proxy, i.e., ecological footprint for environmental quality, and also considers more advanced and robust econometric (second-generation) techniques. The outcomes of the current study reveal that remittance inflows and financial development significantly deteriorate the environmental quality, while technological innovations are an essential factor for the reduction of ecological footprint level. Furthermore, the results of the interaction terms show a significantly adverse effect on the ecological footprint. Additionally, the findings of country-wise analysis reveal that remittance inflows and financial development worsen the environmental quality in each sample country, while the technological innovations promote the environmental sustainability that is steady with panel results. Besides, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis was verified across the BICS economies. Consistent with the key findings, an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between economic growth and ecological footprint in the case of Brazil and South Africa. In contrast, the U-shaped EKC hypothesis exists in the case of China and India. For robust policy implication, the findings of this study highlighted the dire need for ""green policy tools"" that should be linked with the BICS economy policies and driver for sustained growth.",Economics; Natural resource economics; China; Proxy (statistics); Kuznets curve; Remittance; Sample (statistics); Sustainability; Environmental quality; Ecological footprint,EKC hypothesis; Ecological footprint; Financial development; Remittance inflows; Technological innovations,73

New evidence from method of moments quantile regression.,2021-11-29,2021,journal article,Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo; Seyi Saint Akadiri; Adenekan T. Adedapo; Nuruddeen Usman,"As a contribution to the technological innovation-natural resource rent-environment literature, this study examines the technological innovation and natural resource rent in an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) multivariate framework. We employed reliable, robust, and efficient novel panel estimations methods on a sample of 10 newly industrialized countries (NICs) over the periods 1990 and 2018. To achieve our study objective, we employ the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) approach to analyze the effects of the exogenous variables over the range of diverse quantiles of carbon emissions. Results generated from the MMQR mimic that of the three heterogeneous linear panel estimations (fully modified ordinary least square, the dynamic ordinary least square, and the fixed effects ordinary least square) in terms of the sign and magnitude. The result affirms the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in NICs across all quantiles (0.1–0.95). In addition, technological innovation and renewable energy consumption improve environmental quality in NICs across quantiles (0.1–0.95), while the joint impact of technological and natural resource rent mitigates environmental degradation from lower to higher quantiles (0.1–0.90). Moreover, technological innovation is found to exert an indirect favorable impact on the environment through the pathway of natural resources. Thus, technological innovation can be anticipated to enhance sustainable natural resources exploration in the NICs. In line with these crucial outcomes, this research proposes that the NICs should promote technological innovation, promote sustainable natural resource exploitation, and expedite economic expansion rates via the sustainable transformation of their production and consumption processes.",Quantile; Consumption (economics); Econometrics; Economics; Newly industrialized country; Environmental degradation; Kuznets curve; Natural resource; Quantile regression; Ordinary least squares,Economic growth; Method of moments quantile regression; NICs; Natural resource rent; Renewable energy consumption; Technological innovation,25

To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide empirical evidence by investigating the effects of highways on regional green technological innovation in China. The paper elaborates theoretically on three mechanisms through which the development of highways may influence regional green technological innovation, namely the agglomeration effect, spatial spillover effect, and network effect. To advance the empirical analysis, this paper constructs a spatial Durbin model accounting for spatial interdependencies among regions. Unlike previous literature, this paper uses “the strength of economic linkage” to indicate the development of highways in each city and discusses geographic distance and time-distance effect (spatio-temporal effect) resulting from highways. Using panel data of 105 prefecture-level cities in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2001 to 2013, we find that: (1) highway has a significant role in promoting regional green technological innovation; (2) significant spatial spillover effects resulting from highways exist and the magnitude of the influence varies with geographical and temporal distance effect.

To deal with this dilemma, this study investigates the export competitiveness of China’s manufacturing industry from the viewpoint of export value added. The Porter hypothesis is applied for an empirical investigation of the effect of environmental regulation on export competitiveness and to determine the presence of intra-industry heterogeneity. Furthermore, this study seeks to understand the mechanisms through which environmental regulation affects export competitiveness by exploring the two main approaches to technological innovation. The findings reveal that environmental regulation has a promotion effect of approximately 2% on the export competitiveness of China’s manufacturing industry; however, this effect is non-linear and displays a “U-shaped” tendency, indicating that certain prerequisites must be fulfilled to validate the Porter hypothesis. In addition, the effect of environmental regulation displays significant intra-industry heterogeneity, which is evident primarily in heavily polluting sub-industries and to a lesser extent in moderately polluting sub-industries but insignificant in lightly polluting sub-industries. Environmental regulation also differs significantly in the mechanisms through which it affects different approaches to technological innovation. Independent research and development is affected by environmental regulation through the compliance cost effect, which limits export competitiveness, while technology introduction is affected by the innovation offset effect, which favors export competitiveness. These findings offer political implications for the sustainable development of the ecological environment and foreign trade.",Empirical research; Business; Manufacturing; Porter hypothesis; Revealed comparative advantage; Dilemma; Compliance cost; Industrial organization; Sustainable development; Developing country,Chinese manufacturing; environmental regulation; export competitiveness; export value added; revealed comparative advantage; technological innovation,26

Therefore, improving energy efficiency is essential to decrease energy demand and, consequently, reduce costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study was to compute energy efficiency and assess the influence of technological innovation on technically computed energy efficiency of the agricultural sector in South Asia. A two-stage analysis was carried out using panel data over the period 2002–2019. First, energy efficiency was computed employing the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach. Second, the influence of technological innovation on technically derived energy efficiency was examined employing a system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. Findings of the SFA approach show that the average energy efficiency of the South Asian agricultural sector was 84%, ranging from 79 to 86%, showing that there is still 16% room for improvements in energy efficiency of the agriculture in South Asia. In addition, this study found that India has relatively high energy efficiency (86%) compared to other countries in South Asia. The study also found that energy efficiency shows a slight upward trend in the agricultural sector in South Asia. The findings of the system GMM revealed that technological innovation is playing a significant role in improving energy efficiency of the agricultural sector in South Asia. Based on our findings, South Asia can reduce energy inefficiency by spending more on research and development (R&D) in the agricultural sector.",Inefficiency; Efficient energy use; Agriculture; Stochastic frontier analysis; Greenhouse gas; Agricultural economics; Natural resource economics; Economics,,0

The test samples of XLPE/stabilizer blends consisting of 1 wt% m-aminobenzoic acid, XLPE nanocomposites consisting of 0.5 wt% nano MgO and XLPE hybrid composite consisting of both voltage stabilizer and nanofillers were prepared. Various physicochemical and electrical properties were measured to analyze the performance of prepared samples. The obtained results show that the addition of nanofillers deteriorates the electrical insulation performance of the XLPE. On the other hand, the voltage stabilizer addition proves to be suitable for enhancing the electrical insulation performance of the XLPE. Meanwhile, the hybrid XLPE composites have shown medium behavior. The voltage stabilizer addition reduces, but the nanofillers increase the space charge density inside the XLPE compared to pure XLPE. It is also found that the dispersion of the voltage stabilizer in the material is uniform, whereas the nanofillers are aggregated. Furthermore, both additives slightly improve the thermal stability of the XLPE. The trap level theory based on quantum chemical calculation is proposed to explain the influence mechanism of the additives on the XLPE.",Stabilizer (aeronautics); Materials science; Cross-linked polyethylene; Polyethylene; Composite material; Polyethylene oxide; Polymer chemistry,,1

The Latin American approach, proposed by Arocena and Sutz (2003, 2005), is highlighted in this monograph for making opposition to models based on developed economies, presenting directions for the universities that are better suited for countries characterized by technological backwardness, deep social and income inequalities and scarcity of “interactive learning spaces”. The methodology adopted consists of a descriptive analysis of the responses collected with a survey applied to alumni students of the program and the results reverberate the findings of Arocena and Sutz (2010) about the problem of weak knowledge demand in the South and reaffirm the importance of a more activity role of universities in the social development.",Scarcity; Political science; Social change; Opposition (planets); Backwardness; Interactive Learning; National innovation system; Intellectual property; Public relations; Descriptive statistics,,0

Smart orthoses are evolving fast and need a better human-machine interaction performance since biosignals, feedback, and motor control dynamically change and must be adaptive. This manuscript outlines a scoping review protocol to systematically review the smart upper limb (UL) orthoses based on adaptive algorithms and feasibility tests. Materials and Methods: This protocol was developed based on the York framework. A field-specific structure was defined to achieve each phase. Eleven scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, SciELO, Koreamed, Jstage, AMED, CENTRAL, PEDro, IEEE, Scopus, and Arxiv) and five patent databases (Patentscope, Patentlens, Google Patents, Kripis, J-platpat) were searched. The developed framework will extract data (i.e., orthosis description, adaptive algorithms, tools used in the usability test, and benefits to the general population) from the selected studies using a rigorous approach. Data will be described quantitatively using frequency and trend analysis methods. Heterogeneity between the included studies will be assessed using the Chi-test and I-statistic. The risk of bias will be summarized using the latest Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool.

Lioutas; Marcello De Rosa; Yari Vecchio,"<jats:p>The interest in technological innovation has burgeoned in recent years. Theory and research support the vital role of innovative technologies in enhancing agrifood systems resilience. In this theoretical contribution, focusing on different sets of technologies, we present three technological innovation strategies, discuss their potential for strengthening resilience, and expose some open issues that need to be addressed. Responsible technological innovation arose as a response to the growing concerns about the possible unintended impacts of mega-technological trends, like digital farming tools or nanotechnologies, on agrifood systems. Although responsibly innovating is far from easy, and despite the gaps between theoretical ideals and innovation praxis, responsible technological innovation is a promising development since it can prevent counterintuitive effects of technologies on resilience. On the other hand, poly-innovation emerged as a social practice in which internetworking technologies facilitate—and create bundles with—organizational, social, and business innovation. In that strategy, technology represents a mediator of resilience-enhancing social behavior. However, by promoting the uberization of agrifood systems, poly-innovation is associated with various uncertainties. Finally, micro-innovation refers to the incremental adaptations of existing technologies or the development of new ones through bricolage and tinkering. The commercialization of such innovations through open design can increase the resilience of small-scale farming, especially in low-income countries. Nonetheless, the lack of financial resources, technical assistance, and institutional support hamper the full exploitation of micro-innovation.</jats:p>",Resilience (materials science); Commercialization; Business; Emerging technologies; Open innovation; Technological change; Industrial organization; Knowledge management,,0

Serova,"The article is devoted to the study of the state's role in the development of technological innovations. In scientific literature, scientific and technological progress has long been recognized as the most important engine of economic development. However, there are economic and political forces that tend to oppose innovative development and create barriers. The study of the conditions that promote or hinder the development of technological innovation has become one of the mainstream trends in comparative political science. Nevertheless, the constant comprehension of the above-described problem has not yet been completed, and moreover, has led to some contradictions that still remain unresolved. The article analyzes two seemingly competing theoretical approaches to explaining the state's role in the development of technological innovations from the perspective of institutional theory and the theory of ""agency relations"". The author comes to the conclusion that the two theories do not contradict each other but describe “different” dimensions of the problem. While the institutional perspective emphasizes the resource advantage provided by state ownership, the theory of “agency relations” emphasizes the double agency problem with the allocation and use of resources. Both theoretical logics provide powerful arguments, and therefore, their traditional opposition reduces the explanatory power of each.

A large number of heterogeneous firms with macro-regional economic frameworks are included to perform policy simulation scenarios to investigate the impact of diffusing technological innovations on the dynamic changes in the regional economic structures of major global economies (i.e., China, Japan, the United States, Russia, India, and the European Union). This study reveals that process innovation may be more conducive to promoting the transfer of resource elements between regions for China, the EU, Japan, India, and Russia. However, for the U.S., product innovation may facilitate upgrading its industrial structure. Furthermore, from 2012 to 2030, for these six economies, the output share of the primary industry will likely decline by varying degrees, while the output share of the tertiary industry will show an uptrend. The employment share in the tertiary industry in these six economies decreased. Another important finding is that differentiated technological innovation-driven policies must be adopted within the context of global economic governance. Moreover, each economy should choose a technological innovation mode that is suitable for its economic development. Thus, these findings provide an important theoretical basis for formulating global economic governance policies in the future.",Economic model; Primary sector of the economy; Business; Macro; Context (language use); European union; Industrial organization; Tertiary sector of the economy; Resource (project management); Product innovation,,0

We find the following: first, executive compensation incentive, equity incentive and control incentives are beneficial to promote technological innovation in declining enterprises. Second, the degree of decline negatively moderates the relationship between equity incentive and technological innovation. Third, organisational slack positively moderates the relationship between equity incentive and technological innovation, as well as the relationship between control incentives and technological innovation, especially for severely declining enterprises. Fourth, there are synergistic effects between executive control incentive and compensation incentive, control incentives and equity incentive on technological innovation. The contributions are as follows: first, taking declining enterprises as sample, we suggest that to increase the role of compensation incentive and equity incentive in promoting technological innovation in declining enterprises, the control incentives should be strengthened. Second, organisational slack should be fully exploited for severely declining enterprises so that executives should have the motivation and conditions to carry out technological innovation and further help declining enterprises to turnaround successfully. </jats:p>",Incentive; Equity (law); Business; Technological change; Control (management); Industrial organization; Executive compensation; Economics,,0

Although rural areas and agriculture have been often resentful to changes, this process is becoming strongly incorporated in agriculture and rural areas. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to explore in depth the potential impacts of the integration of technological innovations on the future development of agriculture and rural areas. For the purpose of achieving this goal, an empirical study was conducted using a structured interview method and a questionnaire method. The structured interview method was carried out with 18 stakeholders, while the questionnaire method included 114 students of agronomy. The analysis of the interviews revealed three key themes regarding technological innovations in agriculture: ""what hinders technological innovations"", ""what drives technological innovations?"" and ""what are the potentials?"". The analysis of the conducted questionnaire resulted in the conclusions regarding the acquaintance of the students of agronomy with modern technologies in agriculture and which factors represent the most significant influence on the greater activation of young people in agriculture, and thus the greater possibility of living in rural areas.

To cope with these issues, policy makers encourage the development of innovations in terms of products and services: the silver economy. This paper aims to discuss the structuring of this new market and the role played by technologies. The paper studies a French case as it allows evaluation of a public policy. We then confront this empirical analysis with the Regulation theory to explore the institutional arrangements that allow the unity of the silver economy. This new market is thus constructed on economic promises. Technological innovations are presented as a major solution to many problems. As a result, We find that technological innovations play only a minor role in the silver economy at the moment.

This paper divides the countries selected for this study into developed and developing countries and then conducts empirical tests on two sample sets to explore the heterogeneity of technological innovation and GVC division of labor status. The results reveal the following: (1) in developed countries, the GVC division of labor status of high-end manufacturing is generally higher than that of developing countries; (2) in developed countries, the technological innovation of high-end manufacturing plays a significant role in promoting GVC’s division of labor, while developing countries have a significant inhibitory effect; and (3) staff input and financial developmental levels have significantly promoted GVC’s status in the division of labor. Earlier studies have shown that, in developing countries, technological innovation in high-end manufacturing industries does not fully serve the goal of exporting intermediate goods.

Based on super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model, grey-related analysis (GRA) and other models, this paper studies the heterogeneity of the coupling relationship among technological innovation, industrial transformation and environmental efficiency in the Huaihai Economic Zone during the period of 2005-2019. In addition, it analyzes the coupling mechanism of single and binary systems to the ternary system, which is of great significance for the collaborative symbiosis among systems. The findings are as follows. 1) The technological innovation, industrial transformation and environmental efficiency (TIE) systems of the Huaihai Economic Zone had significant spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Although their evaluation value fluctuated, the development trends are all positive. Ultimately, technological innovation is characterized by being high in the northeast and low in the southwest around Xuzhou, while other systems are relatively staggered in space. 2) The coupling of TIE systems is in transition, lack of orderly integration and benign interaction. However, the developing trend of interaction is also upward, and a spatial pattern driven by Xuzhou and Linyi as the dual cores has gradually formed. Moreover, the coupling is mostly manifested as outdated technological innovation and industrial transformation. Except for the final coordination of regenerative cities, the other resource types are all in transition. Cities in all traffic locations are still in transition. The overall system interaction of cities on Longhai Line (Lanzhou-Lianyungang Railway) is relatively optimal, and cities on Xinshi Line (Xinxiang-Rizhao Railway) are accelerating toward synergy. 3) The coupling status of TIE systems depends on the development of the single system and the interaction of the binary (2E) system. The coupling is closely related to technological innovation and Technology-Industry system, and is hindered by the inefficient interaction of Technology-Environment system. Specifically, the synergy of regenerative cities is attributed to the advantage of a single system and the effective integration of 2E systems. Beneficial from the advantages of environmental efficiency, the cities on Xinshi Line promote the synergy of the 2E and TIE systems. Therefore, while the Huaihai Economic Zone stimulates the development potential of the single and 2E systems, it is necessary to amplify the superimposition effect of systems in accordance on the basis of resource and location.",Xuzhou; Economic geography; China; Exclusive economic zone; Resource (disambiguation); Business; Economic system; Geography,coupling relationship; environmental efficiency; heterogeneity; industrial transformation; technological innovation,0

However, it remains unclear whether there is a relationship between stable customer relationships and technological innovation. In this work, we manually collected data regarding customer relationships and the innovation of manufacturing companies listed in the A-Share index in China from 2009 to 2016. Through empirical analysis, this work used a two-way fixed effect model and intermediary effect model tests to explore the impact of stable customer relationships on technological innovation. The empirical research found the following. (1) Stable customer relationships significantly promote the technological innovation of enterprises, and the empirical results are still valid after a variety of robust tests. The competitive advantage of enterprises forms a part of the intermediary role in the relationship above. (2) Comparing the samples of large-scale enterprises, state-owned enterprises, mature enterprises, and low-capital-intensive enterprises, the research found that stable customer relationships can significantly promote corporate technological innovation in small-scale enterprises, non-state-owned enterprises, young enterprises, and highly capital-intensive enterprises. This article enriches and deepens our understanding of the mechanism by which stable customer relationships affect enterprises’ technological innovation. At the same time, this research is helpful for better evaluating the impact of establishing a stable customer relationship on the sustainable competitive advantage of enterprises.",Empirical research; Variety (cybernetics); Business; Work (electrical); Index (economics); Industrial organization; Fixed effects model; Sustainable development; Competitive advantage; Customer relationship management,,0

Using data of 272 prefecture-level cities during 2002-2016 and 2,169 listed companies, and the air ventilation coefficient and government environmental regulations, as the instrumental variables for PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, this paper applies two-stage OLS (2SLS) to investigate how air pollution affects China's technological innovation and its realization mechanism. The results indicate that the rise in air pollution significantly inhibits the technological innovation level of regions as a whole as well as individual enterprises. When considering the spatial effect of the spread of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, due to positive spillover effects on innovation activities, the spread of air pollution has negative impacts on technological innovation activities in surrounding cities. Human capital and labour costs are important channels through which air pollution influences China's technological innovation.

Based on the 2018 Survey Data of Enterprise Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Guangdong Province, this paper splits the credit sources of small industrial and commercial enterprises into three types: formal loan, informal loan, and credit between supply chains, to test which financial service will promote enterprises’ innovation activities, including technological and non-technological innovations. It finds that: （1）Enterprises who can get（more）loans from the formal sector are more likely to choose technological innovation; those who can get loans from the informal sector are more likely to choose non-technological innovation, i.e., innovating the business model or coping with environmental regulations, etc.（2）Enterprises who can get credit from supply chains may benefit the most types of innovation, but the formal and informal loan will promote multiple innovations.（3）To sum up, the formal financial sector plays a more important role on enterprises’ technological innovation activities than the other two informal sources.Further study shows that different financial services affect enterprises’ innovation through different channels. One channel is that formal loan will increase the investment in research and development（R&D）, and then promote technological innovation. The other is to smooth the cash flow mechanism. Informal credit, especially the supply chain credit, may ease the liquidity constraint of enterprises, and then stimulate the innovation behavior indirectly. The results are robust after using instrumental variables（IV-Probit）and considering the heterogeneous bias of enterprises and entrepreneurs.This conclusion may indicate that financial services can benefit small business innovation in China, but formal credit and informal credit have complementary advantages. We hope that this finding can inspire financial policy decisions, and contribute to the small business innovation literature.",Financial services; Business; Cash flow; Loan; Small business; Liquidity constraint; Industrial organization; Business model; Informal sector; Entrepreneurship,,0

In this vein, accelerated economic advancement is driven by a rigorous and proficient financial sector that efficiently utilises and allocates the economy's natural resources. A strong financial system that transforms resources into advantages rests on an advanced technological innovation base, superior human capital, distinct foreign direct investment, powerful trade, and sustainable energy consumption. While this paper investigates the nexus of these factors, the specific purpose of this research is to examine the interactive impact of financial development and natural resource rents on carbon emissions in the new BRICS economies for the duration of 1990 to 2019. The panel data generalised least squares (GLS) and the panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) techniques are adopted. The Dumitrescu and Hurlin technique is used to establish causality. The study found a U-shaped association between economic growth and emissions. The findings prove that the financial development of financial institutions and the financial development of financial markets' relationships with emissions are significantly positive. Natural resource rents, energy consumption, and human capital create a significantly positive relationship with emissions (mostly just positive for technological innovation). Conversely, the connection involving trade and carbon emissions is significantly negative (but mostly just negative for FDI). The interaction (s) intervening financial development of financial institutions and financial development of financial markets with natural resource rent significantly lowers emissions, respectively. The interaction parameter (financial development of financial institutions, natural resource rent, and financial development of financial markets) mixed with trade significantly adds emissions (positively insignificant with energy consumption).

In this paper, first, we analyze the influence mechanism of technological innovation on environmental pollution and then design the index system of technological innovation. Then, we use the entropy method to calculate the technological innovation level of different regions in China based on provincial panel data from 2004 to 2016. Finally, the panel vector autoregression model (PVAR) is adopted, and taking the discharge of sewage, solid waste, and exhaust gas as the research objects, the impact of technological innovation on them is empirically analyzed. The results show that China’s technological innovation level is steadily improving, but there are significant differences in the impact of technological innovation on wastewater, waste gas, and solid waste. Specifically, technological innovation can contribute to an increase in wastewater and solid waste emissions. However, the impact of this technological innovation on them is not equal. Secondly, the impact of technological innovation on exhaust emissions is to inhibit exhaust emissions in the short term and promote exhaust emissions in the long term. Finally, there are clear differences between them in terms of the specific impact of changes in wastewater, solid waste, and exhaust emissions. Changes in wastewater discharges and solid waste generation are largely derived from their own effects, while the role of technological innovation is supportive and insignificant. The change in exhaust emissions is initially influenced by itself, but in the long run, the influence of technological innovation gradually increases and eventually exceeds its own influence. Based on these research results, this paper puts forward corresponding policy suggestions to speed up environmental pollution control.</jats:p>",Technological change; Pollution; Panel data; Municipal solid waste; Wastewater; Environmental pollution; China; Natural resource economics; Environmental science; Business,,1

However, the impact of psychological distance on subgroup reciprocity in such networks has not yet been investigated. To address this gap, the current study drew on theories of faultlines and cohesive subgroups to model the relationship between psychological distance and subgroup reciprocity within technological innovation networks. Our hypotheses were tested using data from 174 respondents working in Yunnan Province, China. The results were as follows: first, psychological distance had negative effects on subgroup reciprocity in technological innovation networks; second, relationship-divisive and innovation-divisive faultlines negatively impacted reciprocity within and between subgroups; third, the faultlines partially mediated the negative relationship between psychological distance and intra-subgroup reciprocity; and fourth, the negative relationship between psychological distance and subgroup reciprocity was not mediated by the faultlines. The findings uncover the psychological mechanism of subgroup reciprocity within technological innovation networks. They will inform the decision-making process of enterprises when selecting partners within their technological innovation networks and support the development of effective reciprocal relationships with other innovators.",Reciprocity (cultural anthropology); Psychology; Reciprocal; Social psychology,divisive faultlines; partner selection; psychological distance; subgroup reciprocity; technological innovation network,1

However, prior research ignored the spatial spillover effects of these factors, and heterogeneity caused by industrialization level and resource dependence did not acquire attention either. Thus, we use the STIRPAT model and spatial panel Durbin model to study the spatial spillover effects of two independent variables. Then, a two-dimensional structural heterogeneity analysis is conducted according to the industrialization level and resource dependence. The results are as follows: improving environmental regulation and technological innovation is good for industrial carbon productivity. Simultaneously, there are obvious regional differences under two-dimensional structural heterogeneity. From the perspective of space, industrial carbon productivity has high spatial autocorrelation, and it can be enhanced through local environmental legislation, as well as technological innovation. Environmental regulation’s spatial spillover impact inhibits the improvement of industrial carbon productivity in surrounding provinces, resulting in a pollution haven effect. However, there is no evident regional spillover effect of technological innovation. Therefore, we provided new perspectives from spatial spillover and structural heterogeneity to optimize low-carbon policies.",Spatial analysis; Economics; Resource dependence theory; China; Productivity; Economic geography; Variables; Spatial spillover; Industrialisation; Spillover effect,,1

Managing innovation, however, is intricately linked to the twin aspects of technology transfer and commercialization of research results, steps that demand different sets of actions and capabilities. Inefficiencies in the process of transfer of technology and a lack of orientation towards the commercialization of scientific research results often lead to ineffective public research. This chapter examines at a public-funded R&D laboratory system in the emerging economy context of India, namely the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the primary umbrella of public R&D laboratories in the country. We dissect the critical dimensions that impact technological innovation by analyzing technological innovation cases referring to seven public R&D laboratories functioning under the CSIR. We further probe the technology outreach performance of the laboratories in the IPR domain in terms of patents filed and accepted in India and internationally over a period of eleven years (2003–04 to 2013–14).

The electrical tree inception, growth, and partial discharge characteristics were simultaneously analyzed at 30, 50, and 70°C, respectively. The results showed that the growth rate of electrical tree and partial discharge activity as well as the discharge repetition rate, significantly increased with the temperature for pure XLPE and XLPE stabilizer blend. However, the XLPE stabilizer blend exhibited higher tree inception voltage, lower tree growth rate, and partial discharge activity than pure XLPE. The addition of the voltage stabilizer reduced the carbon layer thickness in the tree channel and offered higher resistance to the electrical tree growth. Surface potential decay demonstrated that the voltage stabilizer addition decreased the trap energy level, but increased the shallow trap density of the XLPE. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the voltage stabilizer enhanced the ability to buffer the high-energy electrons in the XLPE. A high-energy electron buffering mechanism was also proposed to explain the effect of voltage stabilizer on the electrical treeing and partial discharge activity in the XLPE at high temperatures.",Degradation (telecommunications); Polyethylene; Materials science; Chemical engineering; Electron; Voltage; Polymer chemistry; Composite material; Chemistry,,0

When the discontinuity is a crack the AE is able to follow the nucleation and the propagation of the defect in the material. For this paper, experiment on pre-cracked samples with different notch shape are presented. The samples have been loaded with fatigue cycles and the acoustic activity during the tests has been recorded. The stress was always positive to keep the notched side in traction during the test. During the test AE signals become relevant when the load leads plastic strain near the notch. We noticed an increase of activity when the plasticity advances with a stepped shape. This stepped shape of the number of the events versus time agrees very well with the crack nucleation and its evolution to a fully developed crack. We applied the fractal analysis method to these experiments, to verify the correlation between the fractal dimension (Dt), the applied stress and the order/disorder of the material of the sample. The fractal analysis method is capable to follow the damage status of the sample, while fatigue test.",Discontinuity (geotechnical engineering); Composite material; Fractal analysis; Acoustic emission; Materials science; Fractal dimension; Fully developed; Pre cracking; Nucleation; Plasticity,,0

Herein, this work presents the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered polyethylene glycol based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water-soluble polyzwitterion, is highly nonfouling to proteins and other biomacromolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(ε-caprolactone) (OPDEA-PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis-mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple-negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA-based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules.",Nanomedicine; Micelle; Drug delivery; Bioavailability; Mucus; Transcytosis; Pharmacology; Nanocarriers; Polyethylene glycol; Drug; Chemistry; Materials science,cancer drug delivery; mucus penetrating; oral nanomedicines; polyzwitterionic micelles; transcytosis,3

In particular, much less attention has been provided to investigate how enhancing innovation activities in more technical industries influence the relationship between technological innovation and export. Purpose of this paper is to present a unified framework to empirically investigate the integrated impact of the various technological innovation dimensions on export performance of industrial enterprises in China.,Using a panel dataset of enterprise-level data classified into China’s two-digit capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing industries for the 1998–2016 period and applying system-GMM regressions to control for the problem of endogeneity, the authors empirically investigate the integrated impact of a variety of the dimensions of technological innovation on export.,The authors find that: (1) Domestic R&D efforts and technology spillovers from foreign investment are critical determinants for capital- and technology-intensive exports. (2) External technology may not automatically contribute to export success whereas the interaction of external technology with domestic skill and expertise is a necessary condition for global competitiveness. (3) There exists complementarity between domestic and foreign innovation efforts when they jointly determine export. (4) Chinese government’s trade and innovation policies have significantly contributed to its export growth. Also, the authors examine that the extent of the effect of innovation on export depends upon the type of industry and it is found to be greater in capital- and technology-intensive industries.,This paper fills the research gap in existing literature by distinguishing between different dimensions of technological innovation and integrating them into a unified framework to empirically investigate their impact on export performance of industrial enterprises in emerging countries.

It is well established from past studies that technological innovation is a useful tool for reducing uncertainty across countries. However, it is not known whether this uncertainty can contribute to innovation across countries. Hence, in this study, we develop an empirical model to examine the impact of uncertainty on technological innovation across a global panel of both developed and developing countries over the period 2013–2018. Using generalized methods of moment (GMM), we find that uncertainty have significant negative and positive impact on technological innovation in developing and developed countries, respectively. Given these findings, the study argues that the role of uncertainty in improving technological innovation significantly varies across both developed and developing countries. Therefore, significant implications have to do with the fact that developing countries need to initiate effective action to look uncertainty as a key to unlocking opportunity, while developed countries should take into consideration that uncertainty is a viable strategy for addressing innovation ideas.",Developing country; Technological change; Harm; Economics; Action (physics); Industrial organization; Business,,0

However, the construction of <i>P. pastoris</i> cell factories is largely hindered by the lack of genetic tools for the manipulation of multigene biosynthetic pathways.

First, 23 intergenic regions were selected and characterized as potential integration sites, with a focus on the integration efficiency and heterologous gene expression levels. In addition, a panel of constitutive and methanol-inducible promoters with different strengths (weak, medium, and strong promoters) were characterized to control the expression of biosynthetic pathway genes to the desirable levels. With a series of gRNA plasmids (for single-locus, two-loci, and three-loci integration) and donor plasmids (containing homology arms for integration and promoters and terminators for driving heterologous gene expression) as major components, a CRISPR-based synthetic biology toolkit was established, which enabled the integration of one locus, two loci, and three loci with efficiencies as high as ∼100, ∼93, and ∼75%, respectively, in <i>P. pastoris</i> GS115 strain.

Whilst most empirical studies to date have focused on the impact of cooperation on technological product and process innovations, this study adopts a broader definition of innovation that encompasses both technological innovations and non-technological organizational and marketing innovations taking into account their complementary and interrelated nature. Drawing on a unique sample of traditional manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in three zones, the study shows that cooperation for innovation increases firms’ innovativeness. This conclusion is based on the positive association across the breadth of cooperation, i.e. the number of cooperative ties, with each measure of innovation outcomes, without exhibiting diminishing returns. In addition, empirical evidence suggests heterogeneous effects of individual cooperative ties on innovation performance. Overall, the results indicate that a portfolio approach to cooperation for innovation enhances innovation performance in traditional manufacturing SMEs.

At present, it is still a challenge to control potato common scab in the field. To address this problem, the 972 family lactococcin (Lcn972) was screened from <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> HN-Q-8 in this study, and an <i>Escherichia coli</i> overexpression system was used to obtain Lcn972, which showed a significant inhibitory effect on <i>Streptomyces scabies</i>, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10.58 μg/mL. The stability test showed that Lcn972 is stable against UV radiation and high temperature. In addition, long-term storage at room temperature and 4°C had limited effects on its activity level. The antibacterial activity of Lcn972 was enhanced by Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but decreased by protease K. The protein was completely inactivated by Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Cell membrane staining showed that Lcn972 damaged the cell membrane integrity of <i>S. scabies</i>. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed that the hyphae of <i>S. scabies</i> treated with Lcn972 were deformed and adhered, the cell membrane was incomplete, the cytoplasm distribution was uneven, and the cell appeared hollow inside, which led to the death of <i>S. scabies</i>.

The results of Johansen cointegration show that variables ae cointegrated. The robustness of cointegration relationship is confirmed by applying Gregory-Hansen structural break cointegration. The empirical findings imply that financial development and technological innovation positively and significantly stimulate energy efficiency while trade openness and economic growth negatively and significantly impact on energy efficiency in long-run. The DAG results explain the evidence of causality from financial development, trade openness, technological innovation and economic growth to energy efficiency. The results of forecast error variance decomposition from SVAR model describe that technological innovation has greater impact on energy efficiency in short-term but its impact gradually decreases with the extension of forecast period. On contrary, the promotion effect of financial development and trade openness on energy efficiency increase gradually over time and become highest in long-run. This finding underlines the relevance of technological innovation and trade openness to policy makers in order to achieve energy efficiency in Pakistan.</jats:p>",Economics; International economics; Efficient energy use; Financial development; Openness to experience,,0

The pathogenesis of CDI is intrinsically related to the ability of C. difficile to shuffle between active vegetative cells and dormant endospores through the processes of germination and sporulation. Here, we hypothesise that dysregulation of microbiome-mediated bile salt metabolism contributes to CDI and that its alleviation can limit the pathogenesis of CDI. We engineer a genetic circuit harbouring a genetically encoded sensor, amplifier and actuator in probiotics to restore intestinal bile salt metabolism in response to antibiotic-induced microbiome dysbiosis. We demonstrate that the engineered probiotics limited the germination of endospores and the growth of vegetative cells of C. difficile in vitro and further significantly reduced CDI in model mice, as evidenced by a 100% survival rate and improved clinical outcomes.

Moreover, blockchain was introduced to solve many network issues in regard to data privacy and network single point of failure. In this article, we introduce a solution that integrates both federated learning and blockchain to ensure both data privacy and network security. We present a framework to decentralize the mutual machine learning models on end-devices. A blockchain-based consensus solution as a second line of privacy is used to ensure trustworthy shared training on the fog. The proposed model enables on-end device machine learning without any centralized training of the data nor coordination by utilizing a consensus method in the blockchain.

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.With the promotion of ecological civilization construction, the government has always been concerned about how to achieve technological innovation and upgrading, so as to better carry out emission reduction and environmental protection. Only through technological innovation can enterprises better realize water and energy saving and promote environmental sustainable development. As the second largest tax in China, corporate income tax affects the level of technological innovation through tax revenue and tax preference. In this paper, on the basis of theoretical analysis, the panel data of China from 1998 to 2017 were used to empirically test the impact of corporate income tax on the dynamics of technological innovation. The results show that the corporate income tax has significantly promoted the technological innovation in U shape to some extent, which was further proved by a threshold regression, that is, the short-term income backwardness mechanism and the implementation of tax preferential policies have significantly improved the level of technological innovation. However, with the increase of the burden of technological innovation of enterprises and the defects of tax preferential policies, the promotion level has been reduced. The long-term corporate income tax has reached a certain scale, which ensures the financial revenue and the government's efforts to optimize the allocation of tax resources, reasonably standardizes and plays the role of preferential policies, and increases its promotion role.",Water conservation; Tax revenue; Business; Income tax; Natural resource economics; Revenue; Backwardness; Sustainable development; Panel data; Promotion (rank),,0

This work reports different methodologies to prepare and tune PBs on the GaAs interface (PB-GaAs) and their potential as useful platforms for antibody grafting, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating the innovative and attractive character of the PB-GaAs interfaces in the enhanced capture of antibodies and control of nonspecific interactions. Three different functionalization approaches were explored, one ""grafting-to"" and two ""grafting-from,"" in which atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was performed, followed by their corresponding characterizations. Demonstration of the compatibility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Legionella pneumophila (Lp) antibodies with the PB-GaAs platform compared to the results obtained with conventional biosensing architectures developed for GaAs indicates the attractive potential for operation of a sensitive biosensor. Furthermore, these results showed that by carefully choosing the nature and preparation methodology of a PB-GaAs interface, it is possible to effectively tune the affinity of PB-GaAs-based sensors toward E. coli and Lp antibodies ultimately demonstrating the superior specificity of the developed biosensing platform.",Interface (computing); Surface modification; Atom-transfer radical-polymerization; Biosensor; Nanotechnology; Materials science; Polymer brush; Biomolecule; Polymer; Compatibility (mechanics),,3

The gene encoding pedal peptide/orcokinin-type (PP/OK-type) neuropeptide is an important member of the neuropeptide gene family and is ubiquitous in invertebrates of Bilateria; orcokinin (OK) is mainly found in Arthropoda, while pedal peptide (PP) is mainly found in Mollusca. OK and PP are also present in other animals. PP/OK-type neuropeptides are a kind of multifunctional neuropeptides predominantly expressed in the nervous tissue and play important roles in the nerve regulation of movement. Moreover, OK has a number of other physiological functions. This review describes the distribution, expression, function and maturation of PP/OK-type neuropeptides to facilitate investigations of new functions and receptors of PP/OK-type neuropeptides, providing the theoretical foundation for the potential use of PP/OK-type neuropeptides in the prevention and control of agricultural and forestry pests, as an additive for skin care products and in the screening of drugs for the treatment of diabetes.",Neuropeptide; Function (biology); Endogeny; Receptor; Bilateria; Nervous tissue; Neuropeptide Gene; Neuroregulation; Biology; Cell biology,Neuropeptide; diabetes; multi-function; neuroregulation; orcokinin; pedal peptide,3

To cope with these issues, policy makers encourage the development of innovations in terms of products and services: the silver economy. This paper aims to discuss the structuring of this new market and the role played by technologies. The paper studies a French case as it allows evaluation of a public policy. We then confront this empirical analysis with the Regulation theory to explore the institutional arrangements that allow the unity of the silver economy. This new market is thus constructed on economic promises. Technological innovations are presented as a major solution to many problems. As a result, We find that technological innovations play only a minor role in the silver economy at the moment. However, they reinforce the attractiveness, the legitimacy, and the credibility of the promises and its marketing and organizational innovations.JEL Codes: O3, B52",Public policy; Economy; Economics; Structuring; Credibility; Attractiveness; Process (engineering); Legitimacy,,0

In this context, gold nanoparticles stimulated a growing interest, due to their peculiar characteristics such as ease of synthesis, chemical stability and optical properties. This stirred the development of numerous applications especially in the biomedical field. Exposure of manufacturers and consumers to industrial products containing nanoparticles poses a potential risk to human health and the environment. Despite this, the precise mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity have not yet been fully elucidated. It is well known that the three main routes of exposure to nanomaterials are by inhalation, ingestion and through the skin, with inhalation being the most common route of exposure to NPs in the workplace. To provide a complete picture of the impact of inhaled gold nanoparticles on human health, in this article, we review the current knowledge about the physico-chemical characteristics of this nanomaterial, in the size range of 1–100 nm, and its toxicity for pulmonary structures both in vitro and in vivo.

The non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model proposed by Shin et al. is applied to achieve the research objective. The numerical estimates based on annual data explain that an asymmetric relationship exists between financialization and environmental degradation and between technological innovations and environmental degradation in the long run. An increase in financialization and regression in technology stimulates environmental degradation while a decline in financialization and progress in technology improves environmental quality in Pakistan. Based on empirical evidence, the research emphasizes the suitable channelization of financial institutions towards environmentally friendly projects and formulation of those policies that encourage energy-efficient technologies. </jats:p>",Financialization; Environmental degradation; Distributed lag; Economics; Environmental economics; Natural resource economics; Business,,1

Taking the provincial balanced panel data as a research sample, a fixed effect model, a system GMM model, and a panel threshold model were established for empirical testing and the robustness test. Based on the empirical results, this article draws the following conclusions: from a national perspective, environmental regulations and technological innovation can significantly promote the quality of economic growth; from a regional perspective, there are regional differences in impact effects. Under the constraints of environmental regulations, the promotion effect of technological innovation on the quality of economic growth will be reduced; the impact of environmental regulation on the quality of economic growth will have a ""threshold effect"", and environmental regulation can significantly promote the quality of economic growth only after crossing the threshold and the threshold of technological innovation.</jats:p>",Business; Quality (business); Environmental regulation; Technology innovation; Industrial organization,,0

This research investigates the potential of economic growth, renewable energy use, and technological innovation to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing CO 2 emissions in Kazakhstan. Time series data from 1996 to 2018 were utilized by applying the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS estimate findings show that the coefficient of economic growth is positive and significant with CO 2 emissions, indicating a 1% increase in economic growth is related to a 0.34% rise in CO 2 emissions. Moreover, the estimated long-run coefficient of fossil fuel consumption is positive and significant which reveals that an increasing 1% of fossil fuel energy use is linked with a rising of 6.99% CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, the coefficient of renewable energy use is negative and significant, which indicates that increasing renewable energy use by 1% is associated with CO 2 emissions reduction by 0.38% in the long run. In addition, increasing technological innovation significantly lowers CO 2 emissions, implying that a 1% increase in the number of patent applications is linked to a 0.15% reduction in CO 2 emissions. The empirical findings reveal that economic growth and fossil fuel consumption increase CO 2 emissions in Kazakhstan while increased renewable energy use and technological innovation help to achieve environmental sustainability by reducing CO 2 emissions. This article provides policy recommendations aimed at a low-carbon economy, promoting renewable energy use, financing technological advancement, and environmental sustainability in Kazakhstan.",Greenhouse gas; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Natural resource economics; Fossil fuel; Green growth; Low-carbon economy; Energy consumption; Climate change mitigation; Economics; Environmental impact of the energy industry,,7

However, disordered Ti3C2Tx aerogels with highly tortuous porosity fabricated by conventional unidirectional freeze-casting substantially increase ion diffusion lengths and hinder electrolyte ions transport. Herein we demonstrate a new bidirectional ice-templated approach to synthesize porous ordered Ti3C2Tx aerogel with straight and aligned channels, straight and short ion diffusion pathways, leading to better ion accessibility. The aligned Ti3C2Tx aerogel exhibits the high specific capacitance of 345 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1 and rate capability of 52.2% from 10 to 5000 mV s−1. The specific capacitance is insensitive of mass loadings even at 10 mg cm−2 and an excellent power density of 137.3 mW cm–2 is obtained in symmetric supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of Ti3C2Tx aerogel supercapacitors at sub-zero (to −30 °C) temperatures are reported for the first time. The aligned Ti3C2Tx aerogel delivers temperature-independent rate performance and high capacitance retention (73% at 50 mV s−1 from 25 to −30 °C) due to the unique structure with metallic conductivity.</jats:p>",Aerogel; Materials science; Supercapacitor; Capacitance; Electrolyte; Porosity; Diffusion; Power density; Ion; Chemical engineering; Nanotechnology,,1

This research reveals underlying macro-level trends of diffusion rate assessment using historical technological innovation diffusion data to explore the statistical characteristics of diffusion rate percent-error of the Bass and logistic model time stepped through its lifecycle. A quantitative exploratory data analysis (EDA) based approach was employed to uncover underlying macro-perspective patterns and insights on a technological innovation’s forecasted diffusion rate percent-error using the data of 42 matured U.S. consumer technological innovations. An objective of this effort is to determine the statistical characteristics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) of diffusion rate assessment using the Bass and logistic model at various points in a technological innovation’s lifecycle to reveal underlying directional and associative insights. Specifically, this effort explores the development of macro-perspective knowledge on quantifying the forecasting accuracy of a technological innovation’s diffusion rate using partial diffusion data. Developing such insights and a framework for accessing in situ (real-time) a technological innovation’s diffusion rate percent-error would benefit an organization’s decision makers in maximizing gains and minimizing losses. These insights include identifying whether the Bass and logistic models are more likely to overestimate or underestimate a technological innovation’s diffusion rate when assessed at various points in its diffusion lifecycle. Practitioners can use such information to set resource investment strategies and policies based on risk tolerance and the utility of the weighted outcomes via decision theory tools.</jats:p>",Skewness; Macro; Kurtosis; Econometrics; Diffusion; Computer science,,0

Additionally, when technological innovation affects corporate performance, transformational leadership and transactional leadership have a moderating effect on both the perceived financial and non-financial performance, but the exploitation and exploration of innovation activity had a moderating effect only on non-financial performance. Finally, when market orientation affects corporate performance, transformational leadership and exploration of innovative activities have a moderating effect only on non-financial performance. The novelty of this study lies in that it is more effective to carry out market-oriented activities with a focus on the customers rather than to pursue technological innovation alone in order to improve corporate performance.

However, the usability of these platforms for such applications requires that they can navigate and interact with a certain level of autonomy. For instance, robots should be able to go to their charging station in case of low energy level or telecommunication failure. The remote operator could be assisted by the robot’s capabilities to navigate safely at home and to follow and track people with whom to interact. This requires the integration of autonomous decision-making capabilities on a platform equipped with appropriate sensing and action modalities, which are validated out in the laboratory and in real homes. To document and study these translational issues, this article presents such integration on a Beam telepresence platform using three open-source libraries for integrated robot control architecture, autonomous navigation and sound processing, developed with real-time, limited processing and robustness requirements, so that they can work in real-life settings. Validation of the resulting platform, named SAM, is presented based on the trials carried out in 10 homes.

This is in response to the increasing awareness and legalization of the secondary metabolites from Cannabis sativa, dubbed the green rush. In transgenic synthetic biology applications, NphB is a promiscuous prenyltransferase from Streptomyces sp. often used as a replacement in the prenylation step producing the cannabinoid cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the key precursor to many other cannabinoids. However, its application as a CBGA synthase replacement is limited by its nonspecific regioselectivity in producing a side product along with CBGA. Herein, we demonstrated a detailed and extensive computational structure-guided approach in identifying target residues of mutation for engineering NphB for optimal CBGA production. Our comprehensive computational workflow has led to the discovery of several highly regiospecific variants that produce CBGA exclusively, with the best-performing V49W/Y288P variant having a 13.6-fold yield improvement, outperforming all previous work on NphB enzyme engineering. We subsequently investigated the effects of these mutations by X-ray crystallographic studies of the mutant variants and performed molecular dynamics simulations to uncover an interplay of a H-bonding network and an optimal ligand orientation that favors the CBGA production over the side product. Collectively, this study not only recapitulates the utility of computational tools in informing and accelerating experimental design but also contributes to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms that govern enzyme regioselectivity and readily aids in cannabinoid synthetic biology production for future research into maximizing their therapeutic potential.",Regioselectivity; Computational biology; Cannabinoid; Prenyltransferase; Drug discovery; Biology; Mutant,,2

Using as theoretical framework the dynamic capabilities theory, this article examines the relationship between management innovation, technological innovation, and performance, testing the moderating effect of management innovation. Methodologically, the work uses data from the Survey of Development and Technological Innovation 2015–2016 of the Colombian manufacturing industrial sector. For the analysis, six ordinary least squares and robust regression models are estimated. The results suggest that in Colombia, companies do not achieve better results by introducing technological and management innovations simultaneously, since management innovation negatively moderates the relationship between technological innovation and performance. However, management and technological innovations positively influence firm's performance when they are introduced into companies separately. Theoretically, the work advances the literature on the dynamics capabilities perspective, using it to analyze management innovation, technological innovation, and performance in emerging economies. Empirically, useful information is provided for the design of strategies for practitioners seeking to improve the performance of companies with the introduction of management innovations, technological innovations, and new administrative practices. There is a need to develop a far greater understanding of how the invention and implementation of new administrative practices, organizational structures, or management techniques affect in tandem technological innovation capabilities and firm's performance.",Emerging markets; Business; Secondary sector of the economy; Work (electrical); Organizational structure; Value (ethics); Dynamic capabilities; Industrial organization; Ordinary least squares,,1

This study creates a new technological innovation index through principle component analysis including three important indicators that represent the technology and employs a consistent environmental framework identified as Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The second generation panel estimation technique is employed to calculate robust and reliable outcomes. After confirming the cross-sectional dependency among series, panel unit root tests confirm that all variables are stationary at their first integrated order. Furthermore, Westerlund cointegration test confirms the presence of long-run association among variables. The outcomes explore that financial development and renewable energy utilization significantly accelerate the environmental quality by 0.0927% and 0.4274%, respectively. While, the increase in technological innovation activities, economic growth, and population size has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in the long run by 0.099%, 0.517%, and 0.458%, respectively. Moreover, the results of panel Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H) non-causality test discovered the bidirectional causality relationship between financial development, technological innovations, renewable energy consumption, economic growth, and population size with the ecological footprint. These empirical findings provide some vital policy implications for central authority and policymakers to overcome the detrimental impact on environmental quality in the APEC region.",Cointegration; Economics; Population size; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Unit root; Index (economics); Population; Environmental quality; Ecological footprint,APEC countries; FGLS estimator; Financial development; STIRPAT model; Technological innovations,111

Kamp,"• For large-scale diffusion of technological innovations, a complete technological innovation system (TIS) is needed. • From a company perspective, a TIS framework can be conceptualized by seven TIS building blocks which can be changed by influencing factors. • Information about TIS building blocks and influencing factors can help specify scope, timing and type of introduction strategies. • With the framework the timing-of-entry discussion in the management literature can be unravelled. • The framework can be used to analyse early stages of market formation and diffusion of technological innovations. Pioneering companies of radically new technological innovations often suffer from a slow uptake of their innovations and struggle to find the right introduction strategy. This paper aims to conceptualize a Technological Innovation System framework that can be applied to formulate and study niche introduction strategies from a company perspective. It combines insights from two literatures: the socio-technical systems literature and the innovation & strategic management literature. This results in a framework consisting of seven Technological Innovation System building blocks and seven influencing conditions that can influence the building blocks. The Technological Innovation System building blocks in the framework are: product performance and quality; product price; production system; complementary products and services; network formation and coordination; customers; and innovation-specific institutions. The influencing conditions in the framework are: knowledge and awareness of technology; knowledge and awareness of application and market; natural, human and financial resources; competition; macro-economic and strategic aspects; socio-cultural aspects; and accidents and events. The framework can help explore the context around an innovation during the early stages of Technological Innovation System formation and specify the scope, timing and type of niche introduction strategies that fit this context. This is illustrated with two cases: dual-clutch transmission technology and photovoltaic cells.",Scope (computer science); Context (archaeology); Macro; Competition (biology); Conceptual framework; Innovation management; Business; Product (mathematics); Technological change; Quality (philosophy); Knowledge management; Scale (ratio); Technological innovation system; Industrial organization; Marketing,,0

Inspired by image cropping, a data cropping algorithm is proposed that can significantly reduce the simulation time required in the DNN pre-training process. The algorithm crops the simulated data and adds random data to augment the amount of the dataset. By applying the proposed target-driven DNN, an absorptive frequency-selective transmission (AFST) metasurface structure with a low profile and a broad transmission band is designed. A transmission band from 7.5 to 14 GHz and an absorption rate as large as 0.75 beyond the transmission band are observed. The proposed method provides an efficient strategy to design metasurfaces and a fast solution to the electromagnetic inverse design problem.",Transmission (telecommunications); Computer science; Cropping; Data transmission; Absorption (acoustics); Artificial neural network; Process (computing); Inverse; Algorithm; Electronic engineering; Data-driven; Artificial intelligence; Materials science,,0

This paper collected statistical data of high-tech enterprises in 27 provinces in China from 2009 to 2016, established a novel PSO-GRNN model, and applied sensitivity analysis to explore the influencing factors and regional differences of enterprise technological innovation in Eastern, Central and Western China. The empirical results showed that the influencing factors were innovation investment, market environment, government support and foreign technology spillover sorting by impact size. Innovation investment was the decisive factor of technological innovation, but innovation resources mainly concentrated on Eastern China, severely insufficient in Central and Western China. Market environment was favorable to Eastern and Central China, but unfavorable to Western China, which restricted greatly the development of Western China. The principalagent problem of state-owned enterprise and the crowding out effect of government research and development funds jointly led to the negative influence of government support on technological innovation. Foreign technology spillover had significant positive effects on technological innovation in Western China.

Bove; Gabriele Tuderti; Rocco Simone Flammia; Michele Gallucci; Giuseppe Simone; Maria Giulia Rizzo,"High grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HG-NMIBC) is a heterogeneous disease with variable risk of progression. Urinary microRNAs are promising biomarkers for BC detection and surveillance. Let-7c-5p miRNA, clustered with miR-99a-5p and -125b-5p, is deregulated in cancer, including BC. The aim of this study is to evaluate urinary let-7c cluster expression in Ta/T1 HG-NMIBC patients and its impact on progression-free survival (PFS). Quantitative Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the let-7c cluster expression in 57 urine and 49 neoplastic paired tissue samples prospectively collected from transurethral resection (TUR) HG-NMIBC patients. Twenty urine and 10 bladder tissue samples were collected and analyzed as normal controls. QRT-PCR was also used to detect intra−/extra-cellular let-7c cluster in BC cells. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify urinary miRNAs cut-off values predicting T-stage and PFS. Uni/multivariable Cox regression was performed to identify predictors of PFS. A nomogram predicting progression risk and a decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed. Urinary let-7c was significantly up-regulated in patients compared with controls, while the whole cluster was down-regulated in tumor tissues. Supporting these findings, in vitro comparison of extra−/intra-cellular ratios of cluster levels between BC cells, showed a higher ratio for let-7c in HG-NMIBC versus low-grade cells. Urinary let-7c cluster expression was increased in higher T-stage and was an independent predictor of progression. Lower EORTC-score and downregulation of urinary cluster were predictors of higher PFS on univariable Cox regression, while on multivariable analysis only cluster expression was an independent progression predictor. On DCA, a benefit was evident for patients with a PFS probability > 20%. Urinary let-7c cluster evaluation may improve prognosis, identifying patients at risk of progression and addressing early radical treatment.",Cancer; Internal medicine; Oncology; Disease cluster; Urine; Bladder cancer; Nomogram; Proportional hazards model; Receiver operating characteristic; Medicine; Urinary system,Let-7c cluster  urinary biomarkers  progression free survival; Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; microRNA,9

The Dagum Gini coefficient was used to evaluate the difference in CEE between the three major agglomerations, while panel data models were established to analyze the impact of technological innovation on the three agglomerations. The overall CEE showed an upward trend during the study period, with significant spatial and temporal variations. Additionally, the main source of urban agglomeration difference in CEE evolved from inter-regional net differences to intensity of transvariation. While technological innovations are expected to significantly improve CEE, their effect varies among urban agglomerations.

This paper takes seven Chinese management core journals as samples. The articles in these journals published between January 2000 and December 2019, are used as a database and analyzed by the CiteSpace of knowledge map to detect and visualize the important changes and development trends in the development of enterprise operation and management. It is concluded that the hot spots of Chinese enterprise management mode in the past two decades mainly include supply chain, technological innovation, management science, e-commerce and capital structure and so on. Moreover, innovation and Internet economy are the key points of enterprise management in the future. This study reveals that the reason that hinders the development and expansion of Chinese enterprises is that the investment in financial assets and physical assets occupies the proportion of investment in scientific research and development, leading to the low degree of technological innovation and management innovation of enterprises. Therefore, this paper has a guiding effect on the reform and development of enterprises and helps enterprises to enhance their innovation driving force.",Supply chain; The Internet; Business; Capital structure; Digital economy; Market research; Investment (macroeconomics); Pace; Enterprise management; Industrial organization,,0

A commonly used method for monitoring the dengue vector is to count the eggs that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have laid in spatially distributed ovitraps. Given this approach, the present study uses a database collected from 397 ovitraps allocated across the city of Natal, RN-Brazil. The Egg Density Index for each neighborhood was computed weekly, over four complete years (from 2016 to 2019), and simultaneously analyzed with the dengue case incidence. Our results illustrate that the incidence of dengue is related to the socioeconomic level of the neighborhoods in the city of Natal. A deep learning algorithm was used to predict future dengue case incidence, either based on the previous weeks of dengue incidence or the number of eggs present in the ovitraps. The analysis reveals that ovitrap data allows earlier prediction (four to six weeks) compared to dengue incidence itself (one week). Therefore, the results validate that the quantification of Aedes aegypti eggs can be valuable for the early planning of public health interventions.",Dengue fever; Incidence (geometry); Socioeconomic status; Aedes aegypti; Outbreak; Scale (ratio); Geography; Environmental health; Psychological intervention; Demography; Aedes; Public health; Medicine,,2

This paper firstly constructs an evaluation index system for Guangzhou’s scientific and technological innovation ability. As we know that the traditional DEA model only pays attention to its own superiority index, ignoring the problem that there are too many effective units, which lead to the inability to give accurate ranking results of effective decision-making units. In order to overcome the limitations of the DEA model, this paper uses three types of cross-efficiency DEA models, including the friendly, confrontational and neutral type, to obtain the efficiency values and precise ranking of each decision-making unit. The results show that the three methods have differences, but they all passed the Kendall’s W test.

This paper, therefore, aims to investigate the association amidst technological innovations and competitive advantage. Significant transformations have been evident in Kenya’s telecommunication industry for the last two decades, which has resulted in intense competition, and technological innovation has become the new face of competition among firms. The study applied the positivism philosophy and adopted the descriptive cross-sectional survey design. The target population comprised all 83 large licensed telecommunications service providers where census method was used. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized in the analysis of data. Descriptive statistics comprised of frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations while inferential statistics used linear regression analysis which was employed in testing the hypothesis. Findings reveal a significant and positive influence of technological innovation on competitive advantage. Technological innovation explained the variations in competitive advantage. It is deduced from the findings that more technologically innovative telecommunication firms are likely to produce better products and services and consequently able to acquire more customers earning competitive advantage compared to less innovative telecommunication firms. The study presented notable implications on the policy framework, the strategic management practice, and theory implications in the telecommunication industry and beyond. At policy level, the Government of Kenya would benefit from the study by ensuring that policy makers and regulatory authorities in the telecommunication sector formulate policies that would promote technological innovation for enhancing competitive advantage.

At the same time, the optimization of their resources is a major concern for industries to minimize carbon emissions, boost sustainable practices, and improve a country’s long-term economic development. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) methods on operational performance with the mediation of technological innovation, in the context of Pakistani manufacturing firms. The partial least square-structural modeling (PLS-SEM) method is adopted in this paper. Data were gathered from 223 different manufacturing firms in Pakistan and then analyzed among these variables. The data show good validity and reliability, and structural model explains 61% of the variance in operational performance and 45.4% of the variance in technical innovation, demonstrating its predictive validity. The R-square criteria classify R-square entities of 0.67, 0.33, and 0.19 as considerable, moderate, and weak, respectively. It is demonstrated that all the f-square values are greater than 0.020 and 0.35, indicating a significant effect on the model’s validity. The findings of this study reveal that GSCM practices have a significantly positive effect on both technological innovation and operational performance. Technological innovation has a direct influence on operational performance and has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSCM practices and operational performance. Therefore, this research offers managers insight into the importance of technological innovation and GSCM practice adoption to achieve competitive advantages. It further provides the groundwork for managers, practitioners, and environmental management researchers to emphasize the value of GSCM practice in improving operational performance.</jats:p>",Mediation; Variance (accounting); Context (archaeology); Structural equation modeling; Business; Supply chain; Industrial organization; Reliability (semiconductor); Supply chain management; Marketing; Environmental economics,,6

Survey data on commercialization of patents is related to patent quality indicators (patent renewal, patent family size and forward citations) from archival sources. Among the patent quality indicators, both the length of patent renewal and the size of the patent family indicate that a patent has been commercialized. Patent renewal for at least 6 years is sufficient to predict an accurate probability of commercialization. Furthermore, patent renewal is the only indicator revealing whether commercialization is successful or not. Forward citations have a weak relationship with both commercialization and successful innovation, which may reflect the fact that citations are outside the control of the patentees. Although the correlations of the patent value indicators with technological innovation are noisy, this study provides stronger empirical support for the true relative value of different indicators with respect to innovation.",Empirical research; Profitability index; Business; Empirical evidence; Survey data collection; Relative value; Value (economics); Quality (business); Commercialization; Industrial organization,,0

Evidence from Three Major Regions in China.,2022-06-24,2022,journal article,Wen-Jun Wang; Yan-Ni Liu; Xin-Ru Ying,"At the end of 2020, when China's three-year Blue Sky Protection Campaign was successfully concluded, the main pollutants, led by O<sub>3</sub>, increased instead of decreasing, creating a new air pollution problem. In this paper, the impact of the technological innovation level on O<sub>3</sub> pollution and its inter-regional differences across three major regions from 2014 to 2019 are studied using the dynamic spatial Durbin model. Generally, in terms of ozone pollution showing significant spatial correlation, technological innovations in China are still not effective in curbing ozone pollution. Furthermore, technological innovation is a key factor affecting ozone pollution, and it is heterogeneous, demonstrating that the impact of technological innovation on O<sub>3</sub> pollution is different among regions. Technological innovation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei significantly reduces local O<sub>3</sub> pollution with spillover, while technological innovation in the Yangtze River Delta instead significantly exacerbates local O<sub>3</sub> pollution, and the impact of technological innovation on O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the Fenwei Plain is not significant. Third, other factors in O<sub>3</sub> pollution also differ between regions, with the number of cars and the amount of foreign capital actually utilized being the main factors. Therefore, we should pay attention to the spillover of O<sub>3</sub> pollution and technological innovation and strengthen regional cooperation according to our own characteristics to effectively suppress O<sub>3</sub> pollution. Finally, the findings of this paper are representative, which provides a possible reference for other similar national or regional studies.",Pollution; Beijing; China; Spillover effect; Technological change; Air pollution; Pollutant; Natural resource economics; Business; Environmental science; Environmental protection,O3 pollution; dynamic spatial Dubin model; inter-regional differences; technological innovation,0

An increasing number of companies are relying on supply chain resources in the technology development process. Based on the framework of knowledge resource orchestration and the survey data of Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers in China’s automotive industry, this study comprehensively analyzed the influencing factors of technological innovations in supply chain enterprises. The analysis of the research by the Bootstrapping method found that supply chain relationship quality (SCRQ) positively impacts corporate technological innovations, in which knowledge sharing and knowledge integration play a dual mediating role. The investigation of the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) revealed that individual elements do not constitute a necessary condition for high-tech innovations in supply chain firms. Mutual commitment among supply chain members plays a more pervasive role in generating high-tech innovations. The two results corroborate each other and further illustrate the vital role of the intersection of SCRQ and knowledge management for corporate technological innovations.</jats:p>",Business; Supply chain; Industrial organization; Knowledge management; Automotive industry; Supply chain management; Quality (philosophy); Process management; Marketing,,0

For most authors, innovation can be diversified into product, process, organization and marketing innovation. The objective of this work is to highlight the impact of the adoption of innovations on firms’ productivity in Cameroon, Senegal and Ivory Coast. This work is based on the survey “Determinants of firms’ performance in Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa: The case of Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal” conducted among 1,897 companies (639 in Cameroon, 723 in Senegal and 535 in Ivory Coast ) in 2014 by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). This work uses a methodology consisting of two blocks of equations with a repeating structure. By estimating these equations using the bivariate probit and Double Least Squares (DLS) methods, the study finds that technological and non-technological innovations are complementary and have important effects on productivity of firms. This complementarity is proof that technological innovation contributes better to productivity when it is accompanied by non-technological innovation and vice versa. However, the introduction of new products (or services) accompanied by new methods of organization and marketing have a greater effect on the productivity of enterprises.",Business; Work (electrical); Complementarity (molecular biology); Productivity; Economic geography; Marketing innovation; Sub saharan; Product (business); French; International development,,0

At the same time, the intensity of environmental regulation would affect the emission reduction effect of FDI in the host country. This study aims to reveal the internal mechanisms of this effect. Specifically, this paper studies the impact of FDI on technological innovation in China’s industrial sectors from the perspective of technology transactions from 2001 to 2019, and then analyzes whether the intensity of environmental regulation can promote the relationship. Results indicate that FDI promotes technological innovation through technology transactions. In addition, it finds that the intensity of environmental regulation significantly positively moderates the relationship between FDI and technological innovation, which is achieved by positively moderating the FDI–technology transaction relationship. Regional heterogeneity analysis is further conducted, and results show that in the eastern and western regions of China, FDI can stimulate technological innovation within regional industrial sectors through technology trading. Moreover, environmental regulation has a significant positive regulatory effect on the above relationship, but these effects are not supported by evidence in the central region of China.",Business; China; Perspective (graphical); Economic geography; Environmental regulation; Pollutant emissions; Host country; Foreign direct investment; Affect (psychology); Database transaction,,1

To create a technological epiphany two aspects are needed: a new technology and the attribution of a new meaning. In the proposed educational activity, the technology selected for innovative product design development have been Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). SMAs are stimuliresponsive materials: they use heat or energy as an input to change their shape. SMAs show different qualities as actuators, such as carrying out a significant action; being temperature sensors, operating silently, and being light and hidden. For these reasons, they can establish new user-product relationships, generate surprise and amazement, and enable more sustainable, light, silent, and intelligent systems. The educational activity has been structured following the alternation of a divergent and convergent phases of ideation explained in detail in the following full text. The active participation of a leader company of SMAs technology had a double value: on one hand, the students got in touch with a complex technological reality, while on the other one the company was able to experiment innovation strategies based on technological epiphanies to reach B2C market.

Based on the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2007 to 2017, this paper proposes research hypotheses from the perspective of health investment and technology innovation and then conducts an empirical test of fixed effects panel model based on the Cobb-Douglas production function to prove the relationship between aging and economic growth. Consistent with the mainstream literature, this paper finds that aging does have a significant negative impact on economic growth, that is, for every 1% of population aging, economic growth will decrease 0.089%, but the interaction between aging and health investment or aging and technological innovation on economic growth is significantly positive, namely 0.061%, 0.087% respectively. This means that aging can notably promote economic growth through the paths of health investment and technological innovation. Obviously, The final effect of aging on economic growth depends on the combination of negative effect and positive effect. The findings of this research suggest giving full play to the economic effects of health investment and technological innovation, so as to realize the balanced development of healthy aging, innovation leading, and economic growth.",Empirical research; Population ageing; Economics; China; Investment (macroeconomics); Mainstream; Production (economics); Healthy aging; Development economics; Panel data,,0

Based on the 2011–2019 panel data of 30 provinces in China, this study constructs a spatial Durbin model to examine the spatial spillover effect of environmental regulation and digital finance on green technological innovation. Meanwhile, a moderating effect model and threshold effect model are employed to explore the function of digital finance in terms of the impact of environmental regulation on green technological innovation. The empirical results show that: 1) environmental regulation has significantly promoted local GTI, green invention patents (GIP) and green utility model patents (GUP), while having had negative spatial spillover effects on those three things in neighboring regions. Digital finance promotes GTI and GIP in both local and neighboring areas, but digital finance’s direct and spatial spillover effects on GUP are not significant. 2) A regional analysis shows that different intensities of environmental regulation and different digital finance levels in different regions lead to the heterogeneity of green technological innovation’s response to them. 3) Digital finance produces a positive moderating effect on environmental regulation affecting GTI and GIP in local and neighboring regions. However, digital finance’s moderating effect in terms of the influence of environmental regulation on GUP is not significant. 4) When digital finance reaches a certain threshold, environmental regulation will have a stronger role in promoting GTI. Therefore, to improve regional green technology innovation and environmental governance, the government should strengthen the integration of digital technology and financial services, and promote the construction of environmental supervision systems and green innovation policy systems.</jats:p>",Spillover effect; Environmental governance; Panel data; Porter hypothesis; Economics; Environmental regulation; China; Business; Corporate governance; Industrial organization,,2

We contend that the cause of this dynamic is rooted in industrialization. The evolutionary journey of logistics and supply chain operations, as a practice and an academic discipline, began with mechanization, which triggered the first industrial revolution. This chapter explores the broad linkages between industrialization, technological innovations and demand for goods and services (an indication of consumption) as manufacturing moved through four industrial revolutions - Industry 1.0, Industry 2.0, Industry 3.0, and Industry 4.0. Through an analysis of the production-consumption cycles between industrialization, technological innovations and the demand for goods and services over four industrial revolutions, this chapter has found that economic growth has been the key feature of the entire disruptive process of one technological mode supplanting another. This recurrent feature has spawned different manifestations of the middle class from its origins in Britain through the 'American Dream' and the new rich in Asia to a global version encompassing generations X, Y and Z. The transformative effect of the resultant middle class upon the surge in consumer demand across Industry 1.0-4.0 has ranged through goods, specialized goods, fashion goods and associated services to global goods and delivery services. Apart from reinforcing economic growth, this demand shift has propelled new and different ways of competing, giving rise to technological innovations in manufacturing and information and communications technology, operations processes, and logistics and supply chain capabilities.",Industrialisation; Consumption (sociology); Goods and services; Commerce; Technological change; Business; Deindustrialization; Industrial organization; Economics; Economy,,0

To address the research gap, this study investigated the impact of technological innovations on environmental degradation for selected countries from 1991 to 2018. Due to the presence of cross-sectional dependence, we have applied the second generational panel unit root test and after the confirmation of long-run cointegration, the panel autoregressive distributed lag models based on the mean group, pool mean group, and augmented mean group techniques have been used to calculate the long and short-run estimates. The results indicate that technological innovations have a negative and significant impact on the ecological footprint in the long run but are insignificant in the short run for both South and Southeast Asian countries. The study also confirms the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in both regions.

Ontologically, technological innovations motivate and lie in the existential cycle of the human being. It is argued that the technological innovation stems from the rupture of the life world and the end of circular flow economy in face of the problematic situation and it is the process of trading, disputing, and resolving of such disputes. In this process, through a series of “mangles” and “experiments”, the technological problem is constructed and then solved, and eventually a new association of human and nonhuman is established, thus the life world is renewed and even reconstructed. The essence of human existence lies in technology (being) as well as in innovation (becoming), so it is absurd to deny technology and innovation and the only choice is to do technological innovations responsibly. Responsible innovation means not so much letting responsible people into the innovation process to supervise the irresponsible innovators, but rather to help broaden the innovation vision and to share such responsibilities.",Interpretative phenomenological analysis; Existentialism; Neoclassical economics; Business; Philosophical analysis; Face (sociological concept); Life world; Process (engineering); Circular flow of income; Association (object-oriented programming),,0

This paper examines the long-run and causal impact of technological innovation, economic growth, and renewable energy on consumption-based carbon emissions in Japan. The study utilized quarterly data spanning between 1990 and 2015. The study utilized recent econometrics techniques such as Maki co-integration, ARDL bunds test, FMOLS, DOLS, and frequency domain causality techniques. To the author's understanding, no prior studies have been conducted in Japan using consumption-based carbon emissions as a proxy of environmental degradation. Thus, this empirical analysis contributes to the literature. The findings from the ARDL bounds and Maki co-integration tests revealed evidence of co-integration among the series. The results of FMOLS and DOLS reveal that both renewable energy and technological innovation improve the environmental quality, while economic growth harms the quality of the environment. The results of the frequency-domain causality technique reveal that technological innovation, renewable energy, and economic growth can significantly predict consumption-based carbon emissions in Japan. Based on these outcomes, we suggested that Japan's government should be careful when formulating policies that trigger growth, which will have a detrimental impact on the environmental quality. Our empirical outcome also revealed that any policy that encourages renewable energy should be encouraged since it enhances environmental quality.",Global warming; Consumption (economics); Economics; Natural resource economics; Renewable energy; Environmental degradation; Quality (business); Environmental pollution; Greenhouse gas; Environmental quality,,1

Specifically, the authors analyse the determinants of innovation and assess the role of technological and non-technological innovations in performance.,Based on a sample of 508 Cameroonian SMEs, the PSM (propensity score matching) technique was used to reduce the selection bias inherent in this type of analysis.,The results show that technological innovation does not influence significantly the performance of SMEs, whereas non-technological innovation positively influences it. The combination of these two types of innovation leads to better performance than even accentuated development of only one type.,To improve the performance of SMEs, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive innovation policy that combines non-technological and technological innovations. In addition, it is important to intensify informations and communication technologies (ICT) promotion policies that contribute to the adoption of innovations within enterprises.,This paper contributes to the literature by showing the role of technological and non-technological innovations in explaining the performance of SMEs. Moreover, unlike the existing work in sub-Saharan Africa, which is limited to testing the innovation–performance relationship, this study also determines the productivity gain generated by innovative firms compared to non-innovative ones.",Business; Work (electrical); Propensity score matching; Selection bias; Industrial organization; Sample (statistics); Small and medium-sized enterprises; Competitive advantage; Information and Communications Technology; Promotion (rank),,1

Additionally, this research also seeks to explore the moderating effect of information sharing in the association between BDU and technological innovation.,Using survey methods and structural associations in AMOS 24.0., the proposed model was tested on SME managers recruited from the largest economic and manufacturing hub of China, Pearl River Delta.,The findings suggest that BDU is positively related to technological innovation (product and process) and organizational outcomes (e.g., supply chain and SMEs performance). Technological innovation (i.e., product and process) significantly mediates the association between BDU and organizational outcomes. Moreover, information sharing positively moderates the association between BDU and technological innovations.,This research provides deeper insights into how BDU is useful for SME managers in achieving the firm’s goals. Particularly, SME managers can bring technological innovation into their business processes, overcome the challenges of forecasting, and generate dynamic capabilities for attaining the best SMEs’ performance. Additionally, BDU with information sharing enables SMEs reduce their risk and decrease production costs in their manufacturing process.,Firms always need to adopt new ways to enhance their productivity using available resources. This is the first study that contributes to big data and performance management literature by exploring the moderating and mediation mechanism of information sharing and technological innovation respectively using RBVT. The study and research model enhances our insights on BDU, information sharing, and technological innovation as valuable resources for organizations to improve supply chain performance, which subsequently increases SME productivity.

MKK3 is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that activates in response to a variety of stimuli. Phosphorylates, specifically the p38MAPK family proteins, contribute to the regulation of a plethora of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, invasion, and cell migration. Genes in carcinogenesis are classified as oncogenes and tumor suppressors; however, a clear distinction is not always easily made as it depends on the cell context and tissue specificity. The aim of this study is the examination of the potential contribution of MKK3 in cancer through a systematic analysis of the recent literature. The overall results reveal a complex scenario of MKK3's involvement in cancer. The oncogenic functions of MKK3 were univocally documented in several solid tumors, such as colorectal, prostate cancer, and melanoma, while its tumor-suppressing functions were described in glioblastoma and gastric cancer. Furthermore, a dual role of MKK3 as an oncogene as well as tumor a suppressor has been described in breast, cervical, ovarian, liver, esophageal, and lung cancer. However, overall, more evidence points to its role as an oncogene in these diseases. This review indicates that the oncogenic and tumor-suppressing roles of MKK3 are strictly dependent on the tumor type and further suggests that MKK3 could represent an efficient putative molecular target that requires contextualization within a specific tumor type in order to adequately evaluate its potential effectiveness in designing novel anticancer therapies.",Cancer research; Oncogene; Cancer; Carcinogenesis; Suppressor; Biology; Context (archaeology); Medicine,MKK3; cancer; oncogene; p38 MAPK; target therapy; therapeutic treatments; tumor suppressor,1

Additionally, it investigates the direct relationship between professional qualification and technological innovation, as well as the influence of the latter with organizational performance. The methodological procedures are of descriptive, quantitative nature and were applied through a questionnaire on an electronic platform, and the data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling estimated using Partial Least Squares, in SmartPLS. The sample includes Accounting Offices associated with the Union of Accounting Services, Advisory, Expertise Information and Research in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (SESCON-RS). The findings indicate that professional qualification influences technological innovation, and latter influences performance. It is observed that technological innovation promotes total mediation between professional qualification and performance, since the indirect effect is significant, while the direct effect is not significant. This way, it is concluded that although the investments with the qualification of the accounting professionals do not directly influence the performance, it promotes a greater technological innovation, which consequently will significantly boost the performance. Theoretically, this research contributes by showing an indirect effect of professional qualification on performance, through the total mediation promoted by technological innovation. In a practical terms, subsidies are shown to infer the relevance of Accounting professionals in qualifying, mainly in the technological terms.",Accounting; Business; Organizational performance; Mediation; Professional qualification; Sample (statistics); Structural equation modeling; Subsidy; Relevance (information retrieval),,0

However, research on this topic will be of great value to the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (the Greater Bay Area). This paper aims to use the mediation model to analyze the role of technological innovation as an mediator variable between financial agglomeration and export trade. Based on the relevant data of the Greater Bay Area from 2009 to 2018, regression analysis was performed using the three equations of the mediation model. The mediator variable was then replaced to conduct a robustness test, and it was found that there is indeed an mediation effect; technological innovation acts as an mediator variable between financial agglomeration and export trade. Therefore, it can be concluded that the financial agglomeration in the Greater Bay Area can effectively promote technological innovation, while technological innovation will inhibit exports to a certain extent.",Finance; Bay; Economies of agglomeration; Business; Regression analysis; Value (economics); Robustness (economics); Export trade; Mediation (statistics),,0

Therefore, technological innovation is the main driver for economic growth and human progress. Spending on innovation, research and development as well as investment in innovation supports competition and progress. Accordingly, sustainable economic growth is achieved. This ensures the preservation of resources for future generations and the achievement of economic and social growth. Moreover, a sustainable educational level of the workforce, investment in research, creation of new products, and investor access to stock markets will be ensured through the development of the public and private sectors and the improvement of people’s living conditions. Our study aimed to measure the impact of technological innovation on economic growth in developing countries during the period 1990–2018. To this end, the error correction model (ECM) method has been applied. The results showed that the variables are unstable in the level and stable after taking the first difference. Co-integration was also tested using the ECM, and Granger’s causality test for the direction of causation. The test results showed that an increase in technological innovation indicators (such as spending on education, number of patents for residents and non-residents, R&amp;D expenditures, number of researchers in R&amp;D, high-tech exports, and scientific and technical research papers.) leads to an increase in economic growth in the short term and the long-run with a long-run and two-way causal relationship between technological innovation and GDP, and short-run causation spanning from technological innovation to GDP. The study also concluded that technological innovation has a direct impact on the sustainability of a country’s economic growth, which is why it is crucial to adopt strong policies that encourage international investors to allocate capital for development in developing countries and thus encourage more research and development.</jats:p>",Economics; Investment (military); Innovation economics; Technological change; Granger causality; Modernization theory; Sustainable development; Sustainable growth rate; Causation,,1

The purpose of this paper is to study the test of animal husbandry investment risksin financial capital allocation and technological innovation. In this paper, through the methods of literatureresearch and investigation, the risks of animal husbandry investment are described from the perspective ofanimal spirits. Through questionnaire survey and relevant data, this paper analyzes the investment risks ofanimal husbandry in the allocation of financial capital and technological innovation from the perspective ofanimal spirits. The results show that when employees feel that they have been treated unfairly, they will lack thesense of responsibility and will do as little work as possible. Most people can accept a 30% wage cut. People'sacceptance of this will be affected not only by the overall economic development of society, but also by moneyillusion in animal spirits. The ratio of resident loan balance to disposable income is increasing year by year,from 0.78 in 2013 to 1.09 in 2017. However, there are many uncertainties and risks in animal husbandryinvestment from the perspective of animal spirits, and precautions should be taken in advance. Accurateidentification of animal husbandry investment risks requires a good balance between allocation of financialcapital and risk prevention, between promoting innovation and risk prevention, and between expandingopenness and risk prevention. Reasonable allocation of financial capital and effective technological innovationcan greatly reduce investment risks in animal husbandry.",Public economics; Business; Venture capital; Investment (macroeconomics); Wage; Loan; Animal spirits; Financial capital; Animal husbandry; Financial risk,,1

It starts by describing the challenges that technological innovation poses for regulation generally, then looks more specifically at the difficulties inherent in regulating fintech. Some financial regulators have been experimenting with new regulatory approaches (like innovation hubs and regulatory sandboxes) in light of fintech’s ascendance, but most of the experimentation so far has focused on supporting private sector innovation, rather than mitigating the negative consequences of that innovation for financial stability. Because the industry’s adoption of fintech innovations (and regtech innovations) poses some challenges for financial stability regulation, Chapter 5 also considers the role that technological innovations by the regulatory agencies themselves (known as “suptech”) can play in addressing those challenges.</p>",Financial innovation; Status quo; Financial stability; Financial regulation; Business; FinTech; Financial sector; Industrial organization; Economics,,0

Technology can be applied in all areas of livestock production, value chain development and improvement of health and safety of workers. Incorporating (bio)technology in innovations and applying such innovations in transforming livestock production require key elements to facilitate the vision, acquisition, adoption/adaptation, successful deployment and safe utilisation. These elements define the “enabling environment”. Their absence hinders the orchestration of technological innovations in livestock production and constrains transformation. A key element of the enabling environment is leadership which has a direct impact on ability to set goals based on needs. Poor knowledge affects definition of tangible roadmaps for applying technological solutions to livestock problems. Systematic elements include available technology, the scale of production, geographical location, resource availability and infrastructural support. Human/societal elements include beliefs and attitudes.

A series of empirical literatures have also examined a significant positive correlation between the two. But these results only demonstrate the relationship between the input of 'diversity' and the output of 'firm performance'. Such research is more of a black box because board diversity must act on certain strategies or decisions to affect firm performance. Some scholars try theoretical analysis with the purpose of opening the black box. In order to verify the relevant theoretical analysis results, this study uses the mediating effect analysis model in the field of psychology, through multiple regression, impulse analysis, variance decomposition and other methods, to thus empirically test the mediating effect of technological innovation in the process of board diversification promoting corporate performance. We found that board diversity can improve firm performance by enhancing the level of technological innovation. Among them, technological innovation has played a complete mediating role in the diversity of board members' functional and occupational background, and played a partial mediating role in the diversification of directors' part-time jobs. Technological innovation is a key indicator bridging board diversity and firm performance. This study can explore and explain the inner workings of the significant relationship between board diversity and firm performance, and link research findings on similar phenomena.

We examine how the discourse can potentially marginalize users’ experiences and perpetuate assumptions about the role of technology to solve problems. We analyze three technological innovations reported in the mainstream press and the way the promotion of these innovations demonstrates a “grand” narrative of innovation discourse.

Wang,"First of all, this paper which is based on the panel data of 30 provinces, 27 manufacturing industries, and 1164 listed manufacturing companies in China measures the technological innovation efficiency of the manufacturing industry and then establishes the dynamic system generalized method of moments model and panel threshold model from the regional, industrial and enterprise levels to analyze the impact of environmental regulations on the technological innovation efficiency of China’s manufacturing industry empirically. The results indicate: three kinds of environmental regulation tools have different influences on the technological innovation efficiency of the manufacturing industry and have a certain time lag effect. Overall, environmental regulation has an inhibitory effect on the technological innovation efficiency of the China’s manufacturing industry in the same period. Still, it has a promoting effect on the lag stage. Threshold regression results show that the market incentive environmental regulation tools have a threshold effect on technological innovation efficiency, and there is an inverted ""U"" type relationship between them. Therefore, China should propose regulation methods according to the environmental pollution situation in different regions, promote enterprises to carry out technological reform, and improve the efficiency of technological innovation.",Business; Generalized method of moments; Manufacturing; Environmental engineering science; China; Threshold model; Environmental pollution; Incentive; Industrial organization; Panel data,,0

Researchers are paying more and more attention to social innovation beside the classical Schumpeterian approach. Social innovation is new solutions (product, technology, organizational solution) that can effectively meet market needs that are not or hardly met on a market basis, innovation can lead to new or more advanced skills / relationships, and contribute to a more efficient use of resources. However, there is no uniform definition of the concept. The issue of social innovation is particularly important in the case of the Northern Hungary region, because it can bring hope for some peripheral areas and a new approach to solving problems. High technological innovation potential and performance do not necessarily go hand in hand with high social innovation activity, so in the case of peripheral regions there is a hope for social innovations even in the absence of technological innovations.",Product (category theory); Business; Lead (geology); Social innovation; Market needs; Industrial organization; Inequality,,0

This study adopts the Pedroni residual cointegration test to investigate the cointegration properties of the variables under consideration, while the mean group (MG), dynamic fixed effect (DFE), and the pooled mean group (PMG) estimators are employed for simultaneous short- and long-run analysis. The study is based on annual frequency data from 1995 to 2016 with the adoption of panel analysis to show that technological innovation, tourism development, and access to electricity affected the HDI significantly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) over the investigated study period. This is instructive for policymakers, as the highlighted sectors are good predictors of sustainable development. Furthermore, consolidating the results that tourism development, electricity access, and technological innovation improves economic development. On the other hand, the growth-induced, HDI-fitted model reflects the importance of the examined variables in the sustainable development agenda of the continent. For instance, a 1% increase in tourism increases economic growth by 0.0195%. Similarly, a 1% increase in access to electricity and technological development increases economic growth by 0.0019% and 0.0009%, respectively. In conclusion, this study highlights the multifaceted merits that can be gleaned from access to electricity, tourism, and technological innovation in SSA, as they improve economic growth and HDI indicators that comprise life expectancy, quality education, and per capita income level.",Cointegration; Sustainable development; Tourism; Human Development Index; Panel data; Index (typography); Economics; Economic growth; Technological change; Recreation; Electricity; Business; Natural resource economics; Development economics,,1

We find that listed firms located in cities with higher government R&D expenditures are more innovative than firms in other cities. Further, the positive effect of government R&D spending depends on fiscal instruments and factor allocation. Through subsidies and tax incentives, government R&D spending enhances firm innovation by alleviating financing constraints, improving employee creativity and ensuring efficient operations. We demonstrate that subsidies are more effective than taxes in spurring corporate technological innovation. We also show that the impact of government R&D spending is stronger for state-owned and high-tech enterprises than for other enterprises.

Stamp; Kumaravelu Ganesan; Louis-Philippe Gauthier; Marwan Besrour; Arman Ahnood; David J. Garrett; Sebastien Roy; Michael R. Ibbotson; Steven Prawer; Rejean Fontaine,"Objective. Clinical trials previously demonstrated the spectacular capacity to elicit visual percepts in blind patients affected with retinal diseases by electrically stimulating the remaining neurons on the retina. However, these implants restored very limited visual acuity and required transcutaneous cables traversing the eyeball, leading to reduced reliability and complex surgery with high postoperative infection risks. Approach. To overcome the limitations imposed by cables, a retinal implant architecture in which near-infrared illumination carries both power and data through the pupil is presented. A high efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic cell transduces the optical power to a CMOS stimulator capable of delivering flexible interleaved sequential stimulation through a diamond microelectrode array. To demonstrate the capacity to elicit a neural response with this approach while complying with the optical irradiance safety limit at the pupil, fluorescence imaging with a calcium indicator is used on a degenerate rat retina. Main results. The power delivered by the laser at safe irradiance of 4 mW/mm2 is shown to be sufficient to both power the stimulator ASIC and elicit a response in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), with the ability to generate of up to 35 000 pulses per second at the average stimulation threshold. Significance. This confirms the feasibility of wirelessly generating a response in RGCs with a digital stimulation controller that can deliver complex multipolar stimulation patterns at high repetition rates.",Biomedical engineering; Retinal implant; Stimulation; Retina; Retinal ganglion cell; Visual acuity; Retinal; Retinal ganglion; Computer science; Multielectrode array,,1

However, the rise of minimum wage standard will compress the profit space of enterprises, weaken the advantages of urban investment location, and have a significant impact on scientific and technological innovation. On the basis of theoretical mechanism analysis, this paper empirically tests the impact of minimum wage standard on urban scientific and technological innovation, and explores its micro mechanism based on enterprise-level data. It is found that the minimum wage standard restrains urban innovation. After overcoming the endogenous problem, as well as the robustness test by replacing key variables and adjusting samples, the conclusion is still true. Moreover, the impact of minimum wage standard on urban innovation is sustainable and the duration is more than three years. In addition, with the improvement of urban innovation level, the inhibition effect of minimum wage standard on urban innovation shows the characteristics of “asymmetric V-shaped” change, which increases first and then weakens. The research of micro mechanism shows that the minimum wage will squeeze out the investment of R&D human capital, which is not conducive to the cultivation of micro subject of urban scientific and technological innovation. However, the study shows that minimum wage standard does not significantly squeeze out the R&D expenditure. It is found that the minimum wage can inhibit the agglomeration of urban investment factors and significantly inhibit the improvement of urban innovation level. This paper gives the empirical evidence and mechanism of minimum wage standard restraining urban innovation from the two levels of enterprises and cities. It has important theoretical and practical enlightenment for reexamining the relationship between equity and innovation in the context of innovation-driven development strategy and promoting the implementation of the concept of innovation development and shared development. On the one hand, We should strive to improve the level of urban innovation, improve the layout of urban industries, improve the economic scale and financial development level of the city, encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, encourage enterprises to increase R&D and innovation spending, create a good ecological environment for urban innovation, cultivate the micro basis of urban scientific and technological innovation, and reduce the adverse impact of the rise of the minimum wage on scientific and technological innovation. On the other hand, although minimum wage standard restrains urban innovation, it does not mean that the minimum wage system is unreasonable. On the contrary, minimum wage standard has become an important system guarantee to improve the pattern of income distribution and promote the development of economic sharing. In order to balance the relationship between equity and innovation, it is necessary to build the improvement of the income level of low-income groups into the process of innovative economic development, strengthen the inclusive characteristics of innovation activities, make the innovation achievements benefit low-income groups, and realize the organic integration of urban innovation and income increase of low-income groups.",Standard of living; Economics; Investment (macroeconomics); Human capital; Minimum wage; Profit (accounting); Industrial organization; Equity (economics); Income distribution; Crowding out,,1

137-315-772-421-193,THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION: PROSPECTS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF TWO THEORIES,,2021,journal article,A. А. Serova,"<jats:p>The article is devoted to the study of the state's role in the development of technological innovations. In scientific literature, scientific and technological progress has long been recognized as the most important engine of economic development. However, there are economic and political forces that tend to oppose innovative development and create barriers. The study of the conditions that promote or hinder the development of technological innovation has become one of the mainstream trends in comparative political science. Nevertheless, the constant comprehension of the above-described problem has not yet been completed, and moreover, has led to some contradictions that still remain unresolved. The article analyzes two seemingly competing theoretical approaches to explaining the state's role in the development of technological innovations from the perspective of institutional theory and the theory of ""agency relations"". The author comes to the conclusion that the two theories do not contradict each other but describe “different” dimensions of the problem. While the institutional perspective emphasizes the resource advantage provided by state ownership, the theory of “agency relations” emphasizes the double agency problem with the allocation and use of resources. Both theoretical logics provide powerful arguments, and therefore, their traditional opposition reduces the explanatory power of each.</jats:p>",Economics; State (polity); Development (topology); Economic system,,0

Mennuti; Paolo Quaresima; Pietro Salvini; Alessandro Zanini; Marco Evangelos Biancolini,Abstract Fractal analysis appears to be a relevant tool toward the interpretation of acoustic emissions signals related to the stress and damage of the material and this paper shows how it can be adopted for health monitoring of various structures. The fractal dimension quantifies the order/disorder of the signals and is correlated to the applied stress/pressure and loading cycles. The chart of such evolution allows to evaluate nucleation and propagation of a fatigue crack and to understand the margin of safety of the investigated structure in a specific moment of its life. Fractal analysis of EA signals can be combined with other experimental and theoretical techniques to accurately foresee the damage accumulated and the residual life. In this study we have investigated three pressure tanks at known state of ageing and observed a good agreement with other well-stated methods based on acoustic emissions.,Residual; Fractal analysis; Acoustic emission; Chart; Materials science; Acoustics; Fractal dimension; Moment (mathematics); Nucleation; Stress (mechanics),,2

From the perspective of technological innovation, the impact of FDI on China’s environmental pollution deserves further study. With the spatial econometric tools employed to account for the potential spatial dependence of environmental pollution, this study uses the panel data of 30 province-level units in China from 1998 to 2016 to investigate the impact of FDI and technological innovation on environmental pollution. The results show that increased FDI can reduce environmental pollution, confirming the existence of the “pollution halo hypothesis”; technological innovation can reduce the emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke dust but increase the chemical oxygen demand. Therefore, vigorous introduction of foreign capital is good for sustainable development for government, but it is also necessary to pay attention to screening and identifying environment-friendly enterprises with advanced production technology and management experience and to reject high-pollution and high-energy-consuming enterprises eliminated by developed countries",Business; Natural resource economics; China; Production (economics); Environmental pollution; Foreign direct investment; Pollution; Sustainable development; Panel data; Environmental quality,,0

Innovation comprises different concepts based on the application through the product and service Life-Cycle. Technological Innovation has become the governing factor out of all which ensures the successfulness of the Innovation. But Innovation involves great amount of risks which even leads to an organization into a catastrophic situation in the absence of an appropriate Risk Management Strategy. In developing a Risk Management Strategy it is imperative to have a precise knowledge on the impact of Risks related to Technological Innovation, which can be represented by weightages. This paper presents Risks related to Technological Innovation based on the Literature and attempt to establish a relationship among the risks which forms a Hierarchical structure related to Fuzzy – Analytic Hierarchy process (F-AHP). Information unveiled in the literature and the ideas shared by Industry Expertise were the basis for pairwise comparisons. Consistency of the Pairwise comparison has endorsed using the Consistency Ratio. Consistent pair wise matrices were converted into Fuzzy matrices which have been carried out Fuzzy-AHP in obtaining the weightages related to Technological Innovation Risks. The weightages derived, provide a clearer insight on contribution of different risks on Technological Innovation failures and hence giving heads-up on the risks which need prior attention. Furthermore this illuminates the effectiveness of the Risk Management Strategy by providing facts to decide on which risks need to be Ignored, Mitigated, Addressed or Transferred. Thus, precise application of the findings of this research will absolutely help in developing a copy proof Risk Management Strategy which would ultimately offers many opportunities to a business that cannot be realized otherwise.</jats:p>",Consistency (knowledge bases); Analytic hierarchy process; Pairwise comparison; Risk analysis (engineering); Product (mathematics); Process (computing); Hierarchy; Innovation management; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Service (business); Product innovation; Risk management; Knowledge management; Management science; Business,,0

However, SEs particularly at weak NSIs are also decoupling their profit and non-for-profit branches to address conflict among diverse logics. Moreover, the study finds that 12 out of 20 entrepreneurs who identify themselves as technologically innovative did not develop any new technological innovation.,The study shows that being technologically innovative depends on the acquisition of resources and the management of legitimacy challenges, SEs can diversify their innovations by creating more incremental, architectural and modular innovations to address competing demands among logics.,The study reveals that SEs in weak NSIs interact with multiple institutional logics more frequently than their counterparts in strong NSIs. Although this context leads them to diversify their technological innovation, there is a need for improving the NSIs of SEs in developing countries to facilitate the continuity of resource inflow and ensure the legitimacy of their operations.,Integrating two complementary theoretical lenses, the study contributes to the literature by exploring the impact of the interaction between logics nested within a supra system and SEs’ ability to develop technological innovation.",Business; Content analysis; Profit (economics); Social entrepreneurship; Face (sociological concept); Context (language use); Industrial organization; Legitimacy; Resource (project management); Developing country,,3

In this paper, the threshold effect, spatial autoregressive and spatial Dubin models are used to study the threshold characteristics and spatial effect of technological innovation, environmental regulation and the agglomeration of electric power and thermal power industries on haze pollution. It is concluded that the excessive agglomeration of electric power and thermal power industries is not conducive to the prevention and control of haze pollution, technological innovation is conducive to the control of haze pollution, and strengthening environmental regulation is conducive to the control of haze pollution. Electric power and thermal power industries are important sources of haze pollution and have obvious spatial spillover effects. Some policy suggestions are given, such as moderate control of the agglomeration scale of electric power and thermal power industries, strengthening the technological innovation of electric power and thermal power industries, systematic optimization of environmental regulation and strengthening the joint prevention and control of haze pollution in different regions to provide help for the scientific regulation and control of the agglomeration level of electric power and thermal power industries in different regions and effectively reduce the influence of haze pollution.",Haze; Electric power; Pollution; Economies of agglomeration; Environmental science; Urban agglomeration; Environmental pollution; Thermal power station; Thermal pollution; Environmental engineering,,0

Wahab; Victoria O. Odunfa,"The study examined the level of awareness of technological innovations in land administration among stakeholders comprising academics and officials charged with the responsibility of administering and managing land in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nigeria. The study sampled 114 land experts and employed multi-layer non-probabilistic sampling, i.e. cluster, convenience and snowballing techniques. Descriptive statistics of mean score of weighted options (5-point Likert scale), cross tabulation and Kruskal-Wallis test were deployed to analyse the data. The mean score (MS) showed a very low level of awareness of technological innovations among the respondents. The result revealed that, the respondents have a fair knowledge of Geodata Cadastral Database and Land Resource Manager. The compare mean score analysis of the level of awareness against the respondents’ background information revealed that field personnel, GIS experts, HND holders and experienced land administrators were relatively familiar with the technologies in their categories. Kruskal-Wallis was used to test if there is a significant difference in the opinions of the respondents considering variation in their background profiles. The test result showed that there is no statistical significant difference in the opinions of the land experts. The findings signaled that the operation of land administration in the country is still at a basic level, manual and labour intensive. The study therefore advocated for scaling up of sensitisation and awareness campaigns on the technological innovations, synergy between field and academic land experts, training and re-training of personnel and adoption of strong institutional framework that will enhance LAS in the country.",Likert scale; Cadastre; Business; Marketing; Disease cluster; Federal capital territory; Land administration; Test (assessment); Background information; Descriptive statistics,,0

In this report, we evaluated conditions for the capture of live <i>L. pneumophila</i> on a surface by polyclonal antibodies (pAb) and recombinant antibodies (recAb) targeting the bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Using immunoassay and PCR quantification, we demonstrated that, when exposed to live <i>L. pneumophila</i> in PBS or in a mixture containing other non-target bacteria, recAb captured one third fewer <i>L. pneumophila</i> than pAb, but with a 40% lower standard deviation, even when using the same batch of pAb. The presence of other bacteria did not interfere with capture nor increase background by either Ab. Increased reproducibility, as manifested by low standard deviation, is a characteristic that is coveted for biosensing. Hence, the recAb provided a better choice for immune adhesion in biosensors even though it was slightly less sensitive than pAb. Polyclonal or recombinant antibodies can specifically capture large targets such as whole bacteria, and this opens the door to multiple biosensor approaches where any of the components of the bacteria can then be measured for detection or characterisation.",Polyclonal antibodies; Legionella pneumophila; Legionella; Microbiology; Bacteria; Recombinant DNA; Biosensor; Immunoassay; Antibody; Biology,96-well microtiter plate; Legionella pneumophila; bacteria detection; biosensor; polyclonal antibody; qPCR; recombinant antibody,0

This paper considers two pathways that could accelerate technology development: technology introduction and technological innovation. The technology introduced through foreign direct investment (FDI) may enhance the host country’s independent innovation capability, minimize the risk of independent innovation and lower the cost. To that end, a two-stage analysis was conducted at the industrial level for the period 2000–2018 in Guangdong, China. The first stage included an estimation of total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores using the super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology, while the second one included an exploration of how technological innovation and FDI are affecting energy efficiency by using system GMM regression in the whole sample of the manufacturing sector and sub-sample based on R&D intensity. The results indicate that energy use in most manufacturing industries is efficient and FDI participation induced spillovers from FDI have a significant positive impact on energy efficiency. Moreover, the analysis of the interaction term between FDI and technological innovation show that imitative innovation depends on the transfer technology strategy from foreign-funded enterprises to improve energy efficiency. These results have notable implications for energy use policy and sustainable economic development. • Analyze the role of technological progress in energy efficiency improvement in the manufacturing sector. • The competitive effects of FDI have the potential to promote energy efficiency. • Imitation innovation through transferred technology encourages energy use efficiency.",China; Perspective (graphical); Technological change; Empirical research; Economics; Economic geography,,11

An empirical study.,2022-01-31,2022,journal article,Jundi Fan; Thompson Teo,"In 2020, China's R&D investment reached 2442.6 billion RMB, and it ranks second in the world, but the performance of green innovation has not proportionately improved. The question of how to promote the improvement of green innovation performance is particularly important in order to mitigate future environmental problems and issues due to rapid development of China's economy. While past research has examined the relationship between R&D investment and green innovation, they have not explicitly considered the effect of regional technological innovation level on this relationship. Hence, we fill this gap by exploring the relationship between R&D investment and green innovation performance using data from various regions in China from 2015 to 2019, under the effect of a threshold variable, namely, technological innovation. We explore the impact of economic development level, environmental regulation level, foreign direct investment, and science and technology in fiscal expenditures on green innovation performance. The empirical results show that when the regional technological innovation level is used as the threshold variable, the R&D investment has a significant double-threshold effect with the lagging three-phase green innovation performance. When the technological innovation level is low (< 0.1082), R&D investment has a negative impact on green innovation performance. Moreover, when the technological innovation level is high (>0.5837), the impact of regional R&D investment on green innovation performance is sub-optimal. Consequently, the range of [0.1082 to 0.5837] is the best range for the positive impact of R&D investment on green innovation performance. Furthermore, among China's 30 provinces and cities, 24% (mostly areas located in the southwest and northeast of China) have the technological innovation level in the optimal range. Our results help explain the current status of China's R&D investment and green innovation development, and provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of government innovation investment policies.",Investment (military); Lagging; China; Foreign direct investment; Empirical research; Business; Order (exchange); Technological change; Economics; Industrial organization; Economic geography,Green innovation performance; Panel threshold model; R&D investment; SBM-DDF model; Technological innovation level,5

A sample of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2008 to 2019 is employed to test the proposed research model. The results provide support for the argument that the external environmental uncertainty negatively relates to the input and output of technological innovation, in which the acquisition of key resources - capital resources and information resources plays a mediating effect. We also find that corporate social capital mitigates this negative impact. Further, technological innovation of high-tech industries is more sensitive to external environment uncertainty compared with non-high-tech industries. Our results not only theoretically extend previous research by providing a new perspective to explain the mechanism of external environment uncertainty affecting corporate technological innovation, but also provide practical guidance for firms on how to effectively conduct technological innovation activities in a highly uncertain external environment.",Resource (disambiguation); Business; Industrial organization; Key (lock); Technological change; Resource Acquisition Is Initialization; Sample (material); Capital (architecture); Argument (complex analysis); Knowledge management,,0

From the perspective of scientific and technological innovation, taking the grain production process as the research object, a systems model of scientific and technological innovation in grain production is constructed based on the relevant data of Henan Province from 2010 to 2019. Firstly, the internal mechanism of grain production scientific and technological innovation is explored, and the feedback loop of grain production scientific and technological innovation is then established. Secondly, system dynamics and grey system theory are combined to construct table functions and logistic functions to establish the grain production scientific and technological innovation system model. Through testing the model, the stability and feasibility of the model are demonstrated, and the simulation and prediction of the innovation system of grain production scientific and technological in Henan Province are carried out. Thirdly, in order to explore the impact of feasible policy schemes on grain production, seven policy plans are designed to simulate grain production policy scenarios from the perspective of scientific and technological innovation. The results show that: (1) The adjustment of individual policies, especially the adjustment of the protection policy of scientific and technological innovation in grain production or the subsidy policy of agricultural materials, has a weak influence on the improvement of grain output. The progress of agricultural technology is the main support for improving the comprehensive grain production capacity. (2) The future grain growth potential of Henan Province should focus on increasing the yield per unit area, and the protection of cultivated land resources should not be ignored. (3) The combination of policies has mutually reinforcing effect, which leads to an ideal system simulation effect. Finally, from the perspective of the composition of scientific and technological innovation system in Henan Province, this study puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for the implementation of the strategy of “storing grain in technology” in Henan Province.</jats:p>",Production (economics); Technological change; Technological innovation system; Business; Innovation system; Industrial organization; Agricultural engineering; Economics,,0
148-425-690-844-287,The Effect and Mechanism of Innovation Incentives of NEV Heterogeneous Demands：By Comparing the Market Demands of “Government Procurement” “Commercial Operation” and “Private Purchase”,2021-07-03,2021,journal article,Xiong Yongqing; Wang Xi,"It is of great strategic significance for the NEV industry to stimulate technological innovation according to market demands. China’s NEV market demand is mainly composed of “government procurement” “commercial operation” and “private purchase”. The demand formed by the government and other organs due to official affairs is the “government procurement”, characterized by directional, batch purchase and small demand scale. The demand formed by market entities due to commercial operation is the “commercial operation”, characterized by bulk purchase and large demand scale. The demand formed by individual consumers for daily use is the “private purchase”, characterized by single purchase and constant updating of demand. In order to explore how to effectively foster the demands for “government procurement”“commercial operation” and “private purchase”, this study applies the PSM method to analyze the incentive effect and mechanism of the “government procurement” “commercial operation” and “private purchase” markets on NEV companies’ technological innovation, as well as introduces the business-government relationship to reflect the influence of policy resource allocation on the innovation incentive effect of NEV market demands.The results show that: NEV market demands have an incentive effect on technological innovation, among which the demand of “government procurement” is larger than the other two demands; the incentive effect of the three demands is characterized by phased alternation. The innovation incentive mechanism of NEV market demands is as follows: The market demands of “government procurement” and “commercial operation” mainly promote the technological innovation level of NEV companies through the competitive effect, and the three demands, especially the demand of “private purchase”, mainly promote the technological innovation level of NEV companies through the agglomeration effect. Reasonable government-business relationship can effectively promote the innovation incentive effect of NEV market demands, but the regulatory effect of different government-business relationship is also different according to the innovation incentive mechanism of NEV market demands: A higher relationship promotes the agglomeration effect, but inhibits the competitive effect of NEV market demands, especially the demands of “government procurement” and “commercial operation”; a lower relationship promotes the competitive effect of NEV market demands.Based on the above results, this study puts forward the following policy suggestions: Coordinate the demands of “government procurement” “commercial operation” and “private purchase”, give full play to the competitive and agglomeration effects of innovation incentives in NEV market demands, and realize the organic combination of market dominance and government regulation.",Supply and demand; Economies of agglomeration; Business; Government; Order (exchange); Government procurement; Incentive; Resource allocation; Industrial organization; Scale (social sciences),,0

However, these countries have not managed to protect their environmental quality in tandem. Thus, the aggravation of environmental indicators traversing these countries radiates a shadow of uncertainty on their achievement of economic growth sustainability. In this regard, green investment and technological innovations are commonly considered as an effective aspect geared to minimize CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, as these increase energy efficiency and involve cleaner production. Thus, this study investigates the effect of green investment, economic growth, technological innovation, non-renewable energy use, and globalization on the carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions in MINT countries from 2000 to 2020. After checking the stationary process, this study applied fully modified ordinary least square and dynamic ordinary least square methods to estimate the long-run elasticity of the mentioned regressors on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. The outcomes show that non-renewable energy and technological innovations significantly increase environmental degradation. In contrast, the globalization process and green investment significantly reduce it in the long run. Moreover, the interaction effect of green investment and globalization significantly overcomes the pressure on the environment. Similarly, the moderation effect of technological innovation and globalization significantly reduces the emission level in the region. Moreover, the U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis was observed between economic growth and carbon emission across the MINT countries. Furthermore, the findings of the Dumitrescu and Hurlin’s panel causal test disclose that bidirectional causality exists between green investment, globalization, technological innovations, non-renewable energy, and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. This study also recommends some valuable policy suggestions to governments in general and to policymakers specifically which are aimed to endorse environmental sustainability in the MINT countries.</jats:p>",Globalization; Kuznets curve; Economics; Environmental degradation; Technological change; Sustainability; Renewable energy; Investment (military); Porter hypothesis; Granger causality; Natural resource economics,,15

The objective of this paper is therefore to investigate whether excess demography and technological innovation can explain the environmental degradation in the Countries that make up the Congo Basin. By applying the panel ARDL model (PMG), we realized that the demographic variables (Life Expectancy and depending ratio) negatively influence the environmental degradation. We equally found that technological innovation significantly reduces environmental emissions.

This study therefore attempts to explore the role of contributory factors for CO 2 emissions reduction in these countries. Selecting the data period of 1990–2018, our chosen independent variables are gross domestic product (GDP), square of the gross domestic product (GDP 2 ), renewable energy, technological innovation and export quality. Adopting a panel non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach, a pooled mean group (PMG) estimation technique is used to explore the asymmetric linkages between CO 2 emissions and these independent variables. The panel heterogeneous causality test is used to examine the direction of causality. The estimated results have confirmed the existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; and renewable energy and export quality are found as contributory factors for the reduction of CO 2 emissions. Positive stimuli of technological innovation measured by research and development expenditure and export quality index reduce, whereas the negative shocks or counter incentives of these variables increase CO 2 emissions. In regards to causal relationship, bidirectional causality is found between renewable energy and CO 2 emissions, technological innovation and CO 2 emissions, GDP and renewable energy, and renewable energy and technological innovation. In addition, a unidirectional causality is also revealed from GDP to CO 2 emissions, export quality and technological innovation, and from technological innovation to export quality. Policy recommendations are made following the findings. • The existence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis is identified. • Renewable energy and export quality reduces CO 2 emissions. • Negative shocks of technological innovation increase CO 2 emissions. • Bidirectional and unidirectional causality among variables also attained. • Appropriate policies are required to ensure the reduction of CO 2 emissions.",Kuznets curve; Economics; Gross domestic product; Renewable energy; Panel data; Distributed lag; Granger causality; Technological change; Causality (physics); Econometrics; Natural resource economics,,8

This work proposes a commercially scalable solvated-ion-intercalated hydrothermal strategy to demonstrate a record-high volumetric capacitance (511.29 F cm−3) for supercapacitors based on an industrial-level submillimeter MoS2 film electrode (94.2 µm). The intercalated solvated Li+ ions increase the amount of negative surface charge and reduce the formation energy of 1T MoS2, leading to a high metallic phase content of 82.7% with enhanced electrical conductivity. Together with the expanded interlayer distance (≈1.23 nm), this allows rapid electron transfer and ion transport in the excessively stacked ultrathick MoS2 film to be simultaneously realized. Thus, the as-fabricated MoS2||graphene/carbon nanotube asymmetric supercapacitor presents both high energy and power densities, outperforms those of commercial devices, including supercapacitors with submillimeter-thick electrodes and even micrometer-thick electrodes.",Materials science; Capacitance; Optoelectronics; Engineering physics; Nanotechnology; Chemical engineering,,4

An Application of a Frequency Domain Causality Test,2021-03-10,2021,journal article,Tomiwa Sunday Adebayo; Sema Yilmaz Genç; Rui Alexandre Castanho; Dervis Kirikkaleli,"Environmental sustainability is an important issue for current scholars and policymakers in the East Asian and Pacific region. The causal and long-run effects of technological innovation, public–private partnership investment in energy, and renewable energy consumption on environmental sustainability in the East Asian and Pacific regions have not been comprehensively explored while taking into account the role of economic growth using quarterly data for the period 1992–2015. Therefore, the present study aims to close this literature gap using econometric approaches, namely Bayer–Hanck cointegration, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) tests. Furthermore, the study utilizes the frequency domain causality test to capture the causal impact of public–private partnership investment in energy, renewable energy consumption, technological innovation, and economic growth on CO2 emissions. The advantage of the frequency domain causality test is that it can capture the causality between short-term, medium-term, and long-term variables. The outcomes of the ARDL, FMOLS and DOLS show that renewable energy consumption and technological innovation mitigate CO2 emissions, while public–private partnership investment in energy and economic growth increase CO2 emissions. Moreover, the frequency causality test outcomes reveal that technological innovation, public–private partnership investment in energy, and renewable energy consumption cause CO2 emissions, particularly in the long-term. Thus, as a policy recommendation, the present study recommends promoting renewable energy consumption by focusing more on technological innovation in the East Asia and Pacific regions.",Macroeconomics; Cointegration; Distributed lag; Economics; Public–private partnership; Investment (macroeconomics); Sustainability; General partnership; East Asia; Ordinary least squares,,9

The Moderating Role of Corporate Social Responsibility,2022-05-07,2022,journal article,Xiuping Li; Ye Yang,"<jats:p>Technological innovation fundamentally drives sustainable economic development, and green finance provides an institutional guarantee for technological innovation. In this study, we obtained the data from 31 provinces of China during 2010–2019 to set up a green finance indicator system following the entropy method. The focal points in this paper are investigating the relationship regarding green finance and corporate technological innovation, and whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) strengthens such relationship. To do so, we matched the data of non-financial listed companies. The results are as follows: (1) Green finance can significantly enhance corporate technological innovation, and CSR has a positive moderating effect on this relationship between green finance and corporate technological innovation. (2) Based on the results of heterogeneity analysis, the positive impacts regarding green finance over technological innovation are more significant in larger companies, and companies in more economically developed eastern regions. More notably, green finance played a more significant role before 2016 than after. This study offers insights to future references for analyzing the green finance over economic sustainable development characterized by technological innovation.</jats:p>",Business; Corporate social responsibility; Green innovation; Sustainable development; Corporate finance; Finance; Panel data; Technological change,,1

We find an inverted-U relationship between the manager's tenure and both technological and non-technological innovations. The threshold value of manager's tenure beyond which an increase in the manager's tenure decreases innovation is higher for non-technological innovation. Employees involvement in decision-making influences positively both technological and non-technological innovations. However, the effect is stronger for technological innovation. Formality status is found to exert positive effects on both technological and non-technological innovations.

The Moderating Effects of Advertising Intensity.,2022-07-08,2022,journal article,Mengxi Niu; Wentao Ma,"In this study, we examine the effects of firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR), technological innovation, and advertising intensity on corporate financial performance (CFP). Prior research has shown mixed findings for the CSR-CFP relationship. To provide additional evidence and alternative explanations for these mixed findings, we built a moderated mediating model by combining the knowledge-based view with the stakeholder theory. We use this model to examine whether CSR influences CFP by affecting technological innovation, and whether such mediating effects are moderated by advertising intensity. We classify heterogeneous CSR activities into technical and institutional activities. Using data from 2010 to 2018 on Chinese listed firms, we find that superior technical CSR performance can enhance CFP by promoting technological innovation and that it promotes technological innovation to a greater extent when advertising intensity is higher. However, institutional CSR does not affect technological innovation or CFP. The findings suggest that to improve the firm's financial position, its resources should be allocated effectively to technical CSR activities as well as to innovation and advertising.",Corporate social responsibility; Affect (linguistics); Business; Position (finance); Stakeholder; R&D intensity; Marketing; Industrial organization,advertising intensity; corporate financial performance; institutional CSR; technical CSR; technological innovation,0

Recognition of the importance of this issue to the development of enterprises and regions has been reflected in an array of studies and theoretical models seeking to improve technological innovation management in organizations. The present study is part of this context. Based on a broad literature review, it uses knowledge about technological innovation management to propose and test a theoretical analytical framework to evaluate and contribute to the improvement of the innovation management process in manufacturing enterprises. The various theoretical constructs used to create the proposed analytical framework address aspects specific to the success of the technological innovation process. Although it is important to deepen the focal point prioritized by the constructs in their analysis, by focusing on specific factors, they can bias the manager’s perspective or hinder a more holistic and complete view of the problem. The proposed framework was tested using three case studies in the peanut agrifood business in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Main results show that it was capable of capturing the differences in how the studied enterprises carried out technological management. The three companies were classified into one of two groups.

A classical question is whether innovation creates or destroys jobs. The conventional approach contemplates innovation as a transformation instrument of an economy, resulting in economic growth and jobs creation. Another approach points out to various mechanisms which can compensate the primary effect of innovations and cause an ultimate effect of innovations on labour demand to be unclear. In view of the fact that there are many different explanations about the impact of innovations on labour demand, this paper, after the analysis of theoretical and empirical scientific literature in this field, provides an empirical analysis with unemployment as the dependent variable. The authors use data from 28 European Union countries for the period of 1992–2016 and pursue to research how technological innovations affect unemployment rate. There are two core independent variables – expenditure on R&D (research and development) and number of patent applications – as the main proxies for technological innovations. Control variables that affect unemployment are included to the model as well. The model was estimated using a dynamic two-step System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM-SYS) of a panel data system. After the composition of 12 different estimations of the model, the results suggest that, in some cases, technological innovations affect unemployment.",Technological change; Macroeconomics; Control variable; Economics; Generalized method of moments; Variables; Unemployment; Scientific literature; European union; Panel data,,3

As the Yan(燕) State established political and military outposts in the Liaoning area in the late Warring States period, new technologies accepted in the expanded territory also affected the ceramic production in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. The previous researches on the transformation of ceramic production technology and organization in the Proto-historic period Northeast Asia have focused on the question of when and from where the technology was accepted, but this study attempted to explain it as a time-space process of the technological innovation. When the potters with new techniques and their production organizations migrated into a certain region, the contact with the potters from indigenous communities that produced ceramic wares in traditional methods took place. As potters based on different technological systems came into contact, the technology that had been introduced with the migration of potter was transmitted to the indigenous potters through the fabrication learning, and they acquired the new bodily techniques to produce traditional and new ceramic vessels. With these technological transformations, indigenous groups develop into a complex society and develop a new organization for the ceramic production. Along with these technological changes, a new specialized organization of ceramic production developed between indigenous communities. This paper attempted a comparative explanation of the processes of technological innovations in two different regions, the southeastern part of the Korean Peninsula and the upper Han-River valley, based on the agency theory.&#x0D;; </jats:p>",Indigenous; Peninsula; Period (music); Technological change; Production (economics); Politics; Geography; Economy,,0

In terms of the specific weight of technological innovation costs in the total volume of the delivered goods, performed works and rendered services (2,1%), Russia in 2018 ranked 9th among European countries. In terms of its share of the research and development costs in the total cost of technological innovations (45,2%) – 14th place and in terms of the specific weight of the innovative goods, works, services in the total volume of goods delivered, works performed, services rendered (6,5%) – 24th place out of 30. An analysis of the foreign and Russian experience of the innovation organization showed that in order to multiply the share of innovative industrial products in the total production, it was necessary to create such a system of organization and management of scientific and technological development, which, unlike current practice and by analogy with the key principle of modern concepts of the production organization – the principle of “pulling” – would be able to form a real paid demand for applied R & D and subsequently for basic research. At the same time, in addition to the existing stream of ideas from academic science to production, it is necessary to organize a back-stream of demand – from the factory science, which is at the forefront of understanding the current needs of industry – to the applied one and then to academic science within the range of issues really essential for production.",Business; Factory; Total cost; Order (business); Production (economics); Basic research; Current practice; Industrial organization; Analogy; Industrial production,,0

A dream of technological innovations and digital transformations faces the reluctance to spend money for education and science. As a result of analysis of the indicators of economic, innovative, and social development, the authors determine several main tendencies of the modern times, which 'connect' the situation of inequality and implementation of technological innovations.

This manuscript studies technological innovation, production efficiency, and sustainable development and explores the impact of their relationship on Shenzhen. The benchmark test shows a significant negative correlation between the inefficiency of production, labor levels, investment levels, technical levels, and socioeconomic status. From 2001 to 2019, the production efficiencies of 21 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong Province were used as the research object. The Cobb–Douglas production function conducted panel stochastic frontier analysis and TOBIT regression, and the conclusion was robust. The mechanism test found that the economic growth of Guangdong Province, including Shenzhen, is still dominated by labor and investment. Its production efficiency has been dramatically impacted after 2008, and the increase in production inefficiency may be affected by the crowding-out effect of a four-trillion investment. Finally, based on the Tobit regression, we found that the rise in the labor force, capital input, technological level, and socioeconomic development level could reduce Shenzhen’s production inefficiencies by 3.6%, 20.2%, 2.5%, and 4%, respectively. There is still a long way to achieve sustainable development; however, Shenzhen’s technological innovation and mega-city reform process will provide valuable insights for other regions.",Economics; Tobit model; Natural resource economics; Investment (macroeconomics); Production (economics); Inefficiency; Stochastic frontier analysis; Socioeconomic development; Sustainable development; Capital (economics),,1

Thus, the purpose of this paper was to examine how technological innovation mediates the relation between environmental regulation and high-quality economic development. Based on the panel data of 34 industries in China from 2007 to 2015, this paper firstly calculated the green total factor productivity (GTFP) as a proxy variable for the quality of economic development through the super-slack-based measure model, and then analyzed the impact of environmental regulation and technical innovation on the GTFP by making use of the mediation effect model. The results showed that environmental-related policy directly affected the GTFP while technological innovation indirectly moderated this process, where the moderate impact of technological innovation was industrial heterogeneous. Specifically, the relation between environmental regulation and GTFP was positively and partially moderated by technological innovation in clean industries and high-tech industries, while positively but completely moderated by technological innovation in low-and medium-tech industries. Moreover, the mediating effect of technological innovation in pollution-intensive industries was positive but insignificant.",Total factor productivity; Business; Empirical evidence; China; Quality (business); Proxy (statistics); Environmental regulation; Economic growth; Mediation (statistics); Panel data,,7

This study measures the inequality in green technological innovation via an index and examines the influence of digital finance on that inequality using data from 285 cities in China from 2011 to 2018. The results are as follows: (1) Digital financial development alleviates the inequality in green technological innovation, and the greater the inequality is, the stronger the effect of digital finance. The development of digital finance can help regions lagging behind in terms of green technology to catch up. (2) When the financial supervision and environmental restrictions within a region are strict, the development of digital finance is more effective at reducing the inequality in green technological innovation; a higher capacity for governance in the local government and a smaller digital divide strengthen the positive effects of digital finance. (3) The development of digital finance alleviates interregional inequality in green credit, reduces market segmentation, and increases spending on environmental protection, thus narrowing the gap in the capacity for green innovation between regions. These findings not only enrich the literature on digital finance and green technological innovation but also serve as a reference for governmental departments as they optimize their strategy for developing digital finance and coordinating green development across regions.",Inequality; Economics; Lagging; Financial innovation; Sustainable development; Equity (law); Technological change; Corporate governance; Finance; Government (linguistics); Business; Economic system,Digital finance; Green credit; Green technological innovation; Inequality,0

Moreover, these issues are rising every day in Pakistan, as remittances are increasing, technology innovation is ambiguous, natural resources are degraded, and economic expansion might pose serious challenges to the environment. Thus, this research looks at how remittances, natural resources, technological innovation, and economic growth affect carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2)</sub> emissions in Pakistan by controlling energy consumption and urbanization from 1990 to 2019. The Bayer and Hanck test of combined cointegration discloses a cointegration between remittances, natural resources, technological innovations, economic growth, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Moreover, the autoregressive distributive lag model (ARDL) proposes a significant positive association between remittances and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the long run, indicating that the increase in remittances distresses the environmental performance of Pakistan. Our study confirms that natural resources decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emissions while technological advancement, economic progress, energy use, and urbanization increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In addition, the results of robustness checks by employing fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares are parallel to the conclusions of ARDL estimations. Furthermore, the frequency causality test results show that remittances, natural resources, technological innovation, economic growth, energy use, and urbanization cause CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at different frequencies.

Decision-making methods in conceptual design such as traditional information axioms and the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework cannot provide a good solution for systems with strong coupling and nonlinearity. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a decision-making method of design for a coupling system based on a complexity composite method (DMDCC). DMDCC is composed of a prediction model and a synthetic paradigm. In the early stages of decision making of design, design-centric complexity (DCC) theory is used to preliminarily sort the schemes. Then, driven by the twin data of existing products, the complexity of function units is obtained by using the prediction model. The complexity of different function units is composited by the composite paradigm to obtain the total function realization probability of the design scheme. A more accurate calculation of the total function realization probability of new products can assist designers to judge the scheme from the perspective of function and help to guide the decision making of the design of new systems’ development scientifically and reasonably. The engineering example of the bulk traditional Chinese medicine dispensing device is used to verify the scientific effectiveness of the research.</jats:p>",Axiomatic design; sort; Realization (probability); Computer science; Function (biology); Conceptual design; Axiom; Management science; Industrial engineering,,1

This study examines the effect of tax-collection mechanism and management on technological innovation in China from 2007 to 2020. By using a fixed effect model, the findings indicate that a higher intensity of regional compulsory tax collection and management rises the level of technological innovation of enterprises. Strengthening tax collection and management is more conducive to raising the level of technological innovation of midwestern enterprises, non-high-tech enterprises and enterprises in a poor market environment. The concrete impact mechanism shows that tax collection and management improve the level of enterprises and technology innovation by using a tax credit-rating system and enhancing enterprises’ information transparency; the application of the Golden Three system has been more conducive to strengthening tax collection and management to enhance the level of enterprises’ technological innovation. The findings of this study have policy implications for China regarding rising innovation through tax collection</jats:p>",Business; Industrial organization; Cornerstone; Tax credit; Modernization theory; China; Finance,,1

But to achieve technological progress toward energy consumption sustainability, depend on several other factors. To this end, this study examines the role of outward foreign direct investment and international trade openness in innovation-energy nexus for 24 OECD countries for the period 1996-2015. To address econometric issues such as cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, heterogeneity in the panel estimation process, this study employs the Cross-Sectionally Augmented autoregressive Distributed Lags (CS-ARDL), Augmented Mean Group estimator (AMG), and the System Generalized Methods of Moments (SYS-GMM) techniques. Finding reveals that the moderating effects of outward FDI and trade openness in the indirect relationship between technological innovation and energy demand exhibits an inverted U-shape curve. Specifically, this study finds that the impact of technological innovation on energy consumption via reverse technology spillover effect from outward FDI reinforces OECD countries toward energy-saving environmental sustainability both in the short-run and long-run. Furthermore, the joint impact of technological innovation and trade openness on energy demand is negative and statistically significant in the short and long run. This strengthens the efficiency of technologically innovative capabilities of OECD countries to effectively reduce energy consumption. These results are robust to different specifications and consistent across the various estimators, with sets of policy implication discussed.</jats:p>",Openness to experience; Economics; Foreign direct investment; Energy consumption; Spillover effect; Technological change; Endogeneity; Panel data; Nexus (standard); International economics; Generalized method of moments; International trade,,0

New Evidence Based on Panel Threshold Model and Spatial Econometric Model,2022-01-17,2022,journal article,Weiwei Shi; Lin Zhang,"<jats:p>Since the reform and opening up, China’s rapid economic growth mainly depends on the industrial development mode of “high energy consumption and high pollution,” which has caused serious haze pollution. In order to achieve the goal of haze control and sustainable development, we need to give full play to the role of technological innovation. Empirical analysis of the haze control effect of technological innovation has theoretical significance and practical value. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2018 and the PM2.5 concentration data published by the atmospheric composition analysis group of Dalhousie University, this study selects R&amp;amp;D personnel input and technology market turnover to represent the level of technological innovation and uses the panel data model, threshold effect model, and spatial Durbin model to empirically analyze the impact of technological innovation on haze pollution control. The empirical results show that 1) technological innovation can significantly reduce the PM2.5 concentration of the province, showing a positive haze control effect; 2) technological innovation indicates a negative indirect effect on PM2.5 concentration, confirming the “technology spillover effect,” that is, technological innovation also has a haze control effect on the surrounding provinces; 3) with the increase in the province’s economic aggregate, the haze control effect of technological innovation shows a trend of “high low high,” and the role of technological innovation is the lowest in the stage of economic transformation; and 4) from the perspective of regional differentiation, the haze control effect of technological innovation is the largest in the central region, and the smallest in the western region. Technological innovation indicates a positive haze control effect on all regions at all stages of economic development. This study provides policy suggestions for the government and enterprises to use innovation for cleaner production and sustainable development.</jats:p>",Haze; Panel data; Spillover effect; Technological change; Econometric model; Economics; Business; Economic geography,,1

Specifically, the review aimed at examining the challenges facing entrepreneurial growth in developing countries and develop a conceptual foundation that demonstrates the synergy between entrepreneurial growth and technological innovation in developing countries. The literature review found out that entrepreneurial growth in developing countries face challenges associated with the entrepreneurial environment and the individual capacity of entrepreneurs. However, even beyond these, entrepreneurial growth in developing countries still faces a distinct lag in the diffusion of technological innovations from developed countries. This is partly due to low and falling levels of investment in R&D and huge bureaucracies in government procedures. The study concluded that technological innovation has a positive role in entrepreneurial growth in developing countries and thus investment in building the capacity of entrepreneurs, partnerships and collaborations that stimulate technological innovations are critical if the benefits that entrepreneurship offers are to be realized.",Business; Government; Developed country; Investment (macroeconomics); Conceptual foundation; Development economics; Bureaucracy; Developing country; Entrepreneurship,,0

By analyzing data for energy firms in China from 2009 to 2017, this paper finds that technological innovation is not always beneficial to the multi-interests of energy firms. First, technological innovation does not necessarily fully promote the benefit-based performance of energy firms in China. Actually, technological innovation increases the excess returns but inhibits the operational efficiency of energy firms, and has no a significant impact on the firm value of energy firms. Moreover, technological innovation exacerbates the crash risks of energy firms, which is not conductive to the stability of energy financial market. Second, technological innovation may significantly reduce carbon emissions intensity and play an important role in improving the environmental performance of energy firms in China. Finally, a sharp rise in energy prices may inhibit technological innovation activities, and thus influencing the performance of energy firms.",Business; China; Financial market; Enterprise value; Operational efficiency; Sharp rise; Industrial organization; Greenhouse gas; Truncated regression model; Energy (esotericism),,0

To combine acoustic data with visual information in real world settings, spatial correlation must be established. The approach explored in this paper consists of having two robots, each equipped with a microphone array, localizing themselves in a shared reference map using SLAM. Based on their locations, data from the microphone arrays are used to triangulate in 3D the location of a sound source in relation to the same map. This strategy results in a novel cooperative sound mapping approach using mobile microphone arrays. Trials are conducted using two mobile robots localizing a static or a moving sound source to examine in which conditions this is possible. Results suggest that errors under 0.3 m are observed when the relative angle between the two robots are above 30 degrees for a static sound source, while errors under 0.3 m for angles between 40 degrees and 140 degrees are observed with a moving sound source.",Elevation; Spatial correlation; Azimuth; Mobile robot; Sound (geography); Acoustics; Microphone; Microphone array; Computer science; Robot,,0

The XLPE blends containing 1 wt% voltage stabilizers were prepared through a solution-blending method. The addition of voltage stabilizers suppressed the space charge inside the XLPE at high temperatures. The DC conductivity of XLPE and its blends increased with temperature. The DC conductivity of the XLPE blended with the 4-n-propylbenzoic acid was lowest at the different temperatures and electric fields. The DC breakdown strength of the tested materials continually decreased as the temperature increased. Notably, the DC breakdown strength of XLPE with the addition of 4-n-propylbenzoic acid and 3-aminobenzoylmethylamide was higher than the reference XLPE at high temperatures. Moreover, the thermal stability of the XLPE remained unaffected after the voltage stabilizer's addition, whereas the thermal conductivity was improved. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the addition of voltage stabilizers with lower LUMO could effectively buffer the high-energy electrons and improve the DC breakdown strength of the XLPE.

In the recent years, it became evident that epigenetic changes represent one of the mechanisms that contribute to the onset and progression of cancer but also to the development of therapy resistance. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled with next generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a fast and easy technique to track epigenetic changes that result in different opening of the chromatin in regulatory regions genome-wide. The transposase cuts DNA in regions that are open and therefore accessible for transcription factors, regulatory RNAs and proteins that alter the architectural structure of the DNA and drive or inhibit transcription through the RNA polymerase.

To explore this question, this paper examines the possible impact mechanism of Fintech on enterprise technological innovation based on the examination of the impact of Fintech on enterprise technological innovation through a panel fixed effects model, using A-share listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen markets in China from 2011–2019, and further explores whether there is heterogeneity in this impact among enterprises with different traits. The results show that Fintech development can significantly promote firm technological innovation and that Fintech can influence firm technological innovation through two mechanisms: alleviating firm financing constraints and providing market opportunities for firms to enhance their profitability. In addition, the driving effect of Fintech on technological innovation is more pronounced in new firms, state-owned enterprises, and nonborrowed and listed firms. Based on the conclusion, it is proposed that the government should enhance certain policy support for Fintech guided by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, help Fintech empower the real economy, and at the same time promote the deep integration of Fintech and real enterprises, especially to strengthen the identification of Fintech for new enterprises and encourage state-owned enterprises to implement employee stock ownership system, as well as sound market construction to reduce barriers to listing of high-quality enterprises, so as to improve innovation policy effectiveness and provide a reference for the mitigation of enterprise innovation problems in the new situation.</jats:p>",Business; Industrial organization; Profitability index; Identification (biology); Government (linguistics); Mechanism (biology); China,,1

An efficiency matrix is proposed. The empirical results show that the overall innovation efficiency of new energy companies in the Yangtze River Delta Region is above the medium level and that there are phenomena such as the incoordination of input and output ratios in the companies’ innovation processes. The technological innovation efficiency of new energy companies has a two-stage nature, and efficiency gaps in different stages within each company are evident. The low efficiency of technology R&D is a key factor restricting the improvement of the overall innovation efficiency of new energy enterprises.

However, it remains unclear how scientific and technological innovation policies impact the innovation efficiency of high-technology industrial parks and what the impact pathways are. An in-depth investigation of this topic can give an insight into the inherent relation between the scientific and technological innovation policies and technological innovation. By conducting a theoretical analysis, this study empirically analyzed the impact of scientific and technological innovation policies on the innovation efficiency of high-technology industrial parks. The main research methods applied in this study were linear regression and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The results showed that the policy targets drove innovation efficiency in a relatively minor way. Among all policy tools, the demand-based policy tools had the most significant influence on innovation efficiency. The supply-based and environment-based policy tools had notable positive impacts during the lag periods of policies. The policy mix pathways for scientific and technological innovation policies that impact innovation efficiency come in four forms, namely, the targets-directed, demand-driven, supply-dominated environment optimization, and environment-dominated comprehensive pathways. Therefore, this study put forward proposals on classifying and refining the scientific and technological innovation policies and optimizing the policy mix-driven models.",Technological change; Industrial organization; Business; Economics,,0

An important paradigm that underlies the evolutionary theory of innovation is neo-Darwinian evolution. According to this paradigm, evolution is gradualist and is based on the mechanisms of variation, selection, and retention. Starting from the 1970s, new theoretical advancements in evolutionary biology have recognized the central role of punctuated equilibrium, speciation, and exaptation. However, despite their significant influence in evolutionary biology, these advancements have been reflected only partially in evolutionary approaches to economics, strategy, and technological innovation. The aim of this book is to review these advancements and explore their implications, with a particular emphasis on the role of serendipity and unpre-stateability in innovation and novelty creation.</p>",Exaptation; Serendipity; Punctuated equilibrium; Novelty; Evolutionary economics; Darwinism; Evolutionary theory; Evolutionary biology; Sociocultural evolution; Biology; Cognitive science,,6

In such attacks, adversaries utilize IMUs, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, which require zero permissions for access to acquire speeches. A common countermeasure is to limit sampling rates (within 200 Hz) to reduce overlap of vocal fundamental bands (85<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>255 Hz) and inertial measurements (0<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>100 Hz). Nevertheless, we observe that IMUs sampling below 200 Hz still record adequate speech-related information because of aliasing distortions. Accordingly, we propose a practical side-channel attack, namely <i>InertiEAR</i>, to break the defense of sampling rate restriction on the zero-permission eavesdropping. It leverages accelerometers and gyroscopes jointly to eavesdrop on both top and bottom speakers in smartphones. We exploit coherence between responses of the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope using a mathematical model. The coherence allows precise segmentation without manual assistance. We also mitigate the impact of hardware diversity and achieve better device-independent performance than existing approaches that have to massively increase training data from different smartphones for a scalable network model. These two advantages re-enable zero-permission attacks but also extend the attacking surface and endangering degree to off-the-shelf smartphones. <i>InertiEAR</i> achieves the recognition accuracy of 78.8&#x0025; with the cross-device accuracy of up to 60.9&#x0025; among 12 smartphones.",Accelerometer; Computer science; Eavesdropping; Gyroscope; Permission; Inertial measurement unit; Scalability; Units of measurement,,0

The paper further investigates the heterogeneity of this impact given different levels of government attention, different levels of R&D intensity, and different geographical locations. The results show that first, on the whole, intelligence can significantly improve the efficiency of regional technological innovation. This conclusion remains valid after robustness testing and instrumental variable regression. Second, the results concerning the mechanism by which intelligence impacts the efficiency of technological innovation show that intelligence improves the efficiency of regional technological innovation through human capital accumulation, knowledge spillover, and optimization of the allocation of innovation factors. Third, further analysis shows that the beneficial effect of intelligence on regional technological innovation efficiency is obviously heterogeneous.

In addition, since the informal sectors are not included in the official statistics and may be disadvantaged in adopting technological advances, their impact on the environmental quality should be also carefully considered. Thus, this paper examines the direct effect of technological innovation on environmental quality as well as the interaction effect between technological innovation and informal economy. We employ advanced panel quantile regression for 27 OECD countries from 1995 to 2015. The empirical results indicate that the impact of technological innovation on ecological footprint is favorable but heterogeneous across quantiles. The magnitude of impact intensifies as the ecological footprint increases from the lower to middle quantiles of the distribution and then reverts to the average level at the upper quantiles. The shadow economy exerts a negative effect from the middle to upper quantiles of the ecological footprint distribution. Further, higher informality diminishes the favorable effect of technological progress on the environment. The policymakers should strengthen basic conditions for the establishment and adoption of environmental-related technologies as well as tailor environmental policies for the ongoing transition from the informal to the formal sectors.",Quantile regression; Ecological footprint; Quantile; Sustainable development; Disadvantaged; Environmental degradation; Panel data; Distribution (mathematics); Economics; Technological change; Nexus (standard); Environmental quality; Empirical evidence; Quality (philosophy); Natural resource economics; Economic geography,,0

Muluh; Tsafack Miafo Dieubenit; Ngueuleweu Tiwang Gildas,"<jats:p>This paper examines the role of technological innovations on structural transformation on economies of Africa. To attain this objective, it uses a sample of 32 African countries. The estimation techniques are system GMM and two stage least Square. Results indicate that technological innovations, as measured by total patents applications, have a significant effect on per sector value added. This result supports the almost nonlinear relationship of structural transformation since this study shows that manufacturing is the dominant sector in the promotion of structural changes as far as the implementation of technological innovations is concerned. Also, our results highlight that with regards to the African context, manufacturing is the sector in which technological innovation has the greatest impact on per sector value added and by so doing, it promotes structural transformation than other sectors (services or agriculture sector). As policy implication, governments need to encourage technological infrastructure through private and public spending on research and development especially for agricultural development to foster structural transformation.</jats:p>",Context (archaeology); Technological change; Promotion (chess); Agriculture; Private sector; Public sector; Structural change; Sample (material); Value (mathematics); Economics; Business; Economic system; Industrial organization,,0

Taylor; Zigan Wang; Qi Xu,"We investigate the real effects of foreign exchange (FX) volatility on technological innovation. Using a 32-market, three-decade sample, we show that heightened FX volatility associates with significantly lower firm-level RD it is weaker for firms with derivatives hedging, with higher sales, and in countries with better financial development. We also use FX regime changes and the collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to support a causal interpretation",Currency; Economics; Exchange rate; Foreign exchange; Financial development; Sample (statistics); Monetary economics; Volatility (finance),,0

Renewable energy production, technological advancement, and regulatory policy mechanisms can all help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support environmental sustainability. The purpose of this study was to look at the influence of renewable energy development, market regulation, and technological innovation on carbon emissions in the BRICS countries. Renewable energy development is measured by the contribution of renewables to the total primary energy supply. The market regulation represents the measure of environmental regulation policies that the state administrative department uses to manage or limit pollution. Technological innovation is measured by environment-related technologies. To examine the symmetric and asymmetric relationship between study variables, we used a second-generation panel unit root test, linear and nonlinear co-integration tests, and linear and nonlinear ARDL. Using a symmetric approach, we found that renewable energy development, technological innovation, and market-based environmental regulation policies had a considerable positive impact on lowering carbon emissions (CE). Furthermore, the combined effect of market regulation and renewable energy development, as well as market regulation and technology innovation on CE is negative and significant. In the asymmetric specification, we found that positive and negative shocks are not uniform but vary according to ascending and descending movement in the primary variables. In nonlinear specification, the long run effects are higher than the short run. The study suggests renewable energy development, technical innovation, and market-based regulation environmental policies are the main mechanisms to reduce carbon emission in BRICS countries.</jats:p>",Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas; Sustainability; Economics; Environmental pollution; Natural resource economics; Environmental economics; Porter hypothesis; Business; Industrial organization,,0
199-855-228-058-040,The Effect of Technological Innovation on Economic Growth: Evidence from ECOWAS Countries,2022-07-26,2022,journal article,Ismaila Y Jammeh,"<jats:p>This study examines the impact of technological innovation on economic growth in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) from 2008 to 2020, which are lacking behind in terms of their innovation activities. Technological Innovation has a crucial impact on improving the productivity of human and physical capital which will translate to higher economic growth. Given the importance of technological innovation to economic growth, this study empirically investigates the effect of technological innovation on economic growth in these countries and examines how the improvement in human capital, foreign direct investment, institutions, physical capital and annual population growth can stimulate economic growth. The study employed a panel model with a fixed effect, two-ways and time random effect estimation method which helps to observe the heterogeneities in these countries. The study found that technological innovation has a negative impact on economic growth in these countries which is due to its poor institutions and the inability of their governments to formulate and implement policies that will promote human capital development that will produce meaningful technological innovation and/or effectively utilize existing ones.</jats:p>",Human capital; Innovation economics; Technological change; Productivity; Foreign direct investment; Economics; Investment (military); Physical capital; Capital (architecture); Economic system; Business,,0
